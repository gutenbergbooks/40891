<p>Transcriber&rsquo;s notes:</p>

<p>In this transcription, hyperlinks are indicated by a black dotted
underline (plus a coloured highlight when the mouse pointer hovers over
them). A red dashed underline indicates the presence of a
transcriber&rsquo;s comment; scrolling the mouse pointer over such text
will reveal the comment. Footnote markers in the text are hyperlinked to
the footnotes which have been relocated to the end of the book and
assigned a page number in the table of contents to help locate them.
Page numbers are displayed in the right margin. Because of the very
small amount of text on some pages, the page numbers occasionally become
superimposed if viewed on a wide screen.</p>

<p>No attempt has been made to standardise the numerous inconsistencies
throughout the text with respect to punctuation, [e.g. (No. 490,)/(No.
490.)/(No. 490)/(No. 490).], spelling, case and hyphenation [e.g. P.
36/p. 88, DR. MOFFETT/Dr. MUFFETT, Colton/Coulton, toothach/toothache,
Head-Ach/Head-ach/Head-ache, nightmare/Night-Mare/night-mare,
mouthsful/mouthfuls, scum/skum, table-spoonful/tablespooonful,
Curacoa/Cura√ßoa, and others]. These and various archaic spellings all
remain as in the original. The transcription also replicates the
original text in its use of upper case, lower case, small capitals, and
italics.</p>

<p>On the other hand, several errors, omissions and uncertainties have been
corrected after reference to the subsequent edition (3rd) of the book
for clarification: for example, missing characters resulting from
incomplete scan images; missing quotation marks; a missing value for
&lsquo;Port&rsquo; in the table on page 138; and a three-paragraph
apparent &lsquo;blockquote&rsquo; on page 141 (actually a partial
footnote that had become separated from its preceding paragraphs on page
139), has been reunited with the rest of the footnote. A few incorrect
page references have been rectified.</p>

<p>The incorrect sequencing of the index replicates that in the original
publication. In that era the letters i and j were interchangeable, and
words beginning with these letters are grouped together in the index.
The words and abbreviations Ditto, ditto, Do., do., are used
inconsistently in the index.</p>

<p>Numbered items (sometimes asterisked) of the style (No. 463*) are
references to the 3rd edition of &ldquo;The Cook&rsquo;s Oracle&rdquo;
as explained on the page that follows the table of contents.</p>

<p>The text contains archaic symbols previously used by apothecaries,
namely, &#8478; (meaning &lsquo;Prescription take&rsquo;) on pages 232
and 285 and &#8456; (meaning &lsquo;scruple&rsquo; &ndash; a measure of
weight) in Footnote 104. The symbols display correctly with Firefox,
Chrome and Safari browsers, but Internet Explorer sometimes fails to
display them correctly unless its default font is changed to Lucida Sans
Unicode.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;The choice and measure of the materials of which our Body is
composed,&mdash;and what we take daily by <span class="smcap">Pounds</span>,&mdash;is at least of as
much importance as what we take seldom, and only by <i>Grains</i> and
<i>Spoonsful</i>.&rdquo;&mdash;<span class="smcap">Dr. Arbuthnot</span> on <i>Aliment</i>, pref. p. iii.</p>
</blockquote>

<hr style="width: 10em; margin-top:0.1em; margin-bottom: 1em;" />

<p>The Editor of the following pages had
originally an extremely Delicate Constitution;&mdash;and
at an early period devoted
himself to the study of Physic, with the
hope&mdash;of learning how to make the most
of his small stock of Health.</p>

<p>The System he adopted, succeeded, and<span class="pagenum" title="2"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2"></a></span>
he is arrived at his forty-third year, in
tolerable good Health; and this without any
uncomfortable abstinence:&mdash;his maxim has
ever been, &ldquo;<i>dum Vivimus, Vivamus</i>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He does not mean the Aguish existence
of the votary of Fashion&mdash;whose Body is
burning from voluptuous intemperance to-day,
and freezing in miserable collapse to-morrow&mdash;not
extravagantly consuming in
a Day, the animal spirits which Nature
intended for the animation of a Week&mdash;but
keeping the expense of the machinery
of Life within the income of Health,&mdash;which
the Constitution can regularly and
comfortably supply.</p>

<p>This is the grand &ldquo;arcanum duplicatum&rdquo;
for &ldquo;Living all the days of your Life.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Art of Invigorating the Health, and
improving the Strength of Man, has hitherto
only been considered for the purpose of
training<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">1</a> him for Athletic Exercises&mdash;but I
<span class="pagenum" title="3"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3"></a></span>have often thought that a similar plan might
be adopted with considerable advantage,
<span class="pagenum" title="4"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4"></a></span>to animate and strengthen enfeebled Constitutions&mdash;prevent
Gout&mdash;reduce Corpulency&mdash;cure
Nervous and Chronic Weakness&mdash;Hypochondriac
and Bilious Disorders,
&amp;c.&mdash;<i>to increase the Enjoyment, and
prolong the duration of Feeble Life</i>&mdash;for
which <i>Medicine</i>, unassisted by <span class="smcap">Diet and
Regimen</span>,&mdash;affords but very trifling and
temporary help.</p>

<p>The universal desire of repairing, perfecting,
and prolonging Life, has induced
many ingenious men to try innumerable experiments
on almost all the products of the
Animal, Vegetable, and Mineral kingdoms,
with the hope of discovering Agents, that
will not merely increase or diminish the
force or frequency of the Pulse; but with
an ardour as romantic as the search after<span class="pagenum" title="5"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5"></a></span>
the Philosopher&rsquo;s Stone, they have vainly
hoped, that <i>Panaceas</i> might be found possessing
the power of curing &ldquo;all the evils
that flesh is heir to.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This is evident enough to all who have
examined the early Pharmacop&#339;ias, which
are full of heterogeneous compounds, the inventions
of interested, and the imaginations
of ignorant men.</p>

<p>The liberal and enlightened Physicians of
the last and present century have gradually
expunged most of these, and made the
science of Medicine sufficiently intelligible
to those whose business it is to learn it&mdash;if
Medicine be entirely divested of its Mystery,
its power over the Mind, which in most
cases forms its main strength, will no longer
exist.</p>

<p>It was a favourite remark of the celebrated
Dr. John Brown<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">2</a>, that &ldquo;if a student
in Physic employed seven years in storing
<span class="pagenum" title="6"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6"></a></span>his memory with the accepted, but,&mdash;unfortunately,
in nine cases out of ten,&mdash;imaginary
powers of Medicine, he would, if he did not
possess very extraordinary sagacity, lose a
much longer time in discovering the multiform
delusions his medical oracles had imposed
upon him&mdash;before he ascertains that,
with the exception of <i>Mercury</i> for the Lues,&mdash;<i>Bark</i>
for Intermittents,&mdash;and <i>Sulphur</i> for
Psora&mdash;the <i>Materia Medica</i> does not furnish
many Specifics&mdash;and may be almost
reduced to Evacuants and Stimuli:&rdquo;&mdash;However,
these, skilfully administered, afford
all the assistance to Nature, that can
be obtained from Art!</p>

<p>Let not the uninitiated in Medical Mysteries
imagine for a moment, that the
Editor desires to depreciate their Importance&mdash;but
observe once for all&mdash;that
he has only one reason for writing this
Book&mdash;which is, to warn you against the
ordinary causes of Disorder&mdash;and to teach
you the easiest and most salutary method<span class="pagenum" title="7"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7"></a></span>
of preventing or subduing it, and of recovering
and preserving Health and Strength,
when, in spite of all your prudence, you are
overtaken by sickness, and have no Medical
Friend ready to defend you.</p>

<p>Experience has so long proved the actual
importance of <span class="smcap">Training</span>&mdash;that Pugilists
will not willingly engage without such preparation.</p>

<p>The principal rules for which are,&mdash;to go
to Bed early&mdash;to Rise early&mdash;to take as
much <i>Exercise</i> as you can in the open air,
without fatigue&mdash;to <i>Eat and Drink</i> moderately
of plain nourishing Food&mdash;and
especially,&mdash;to keep <i>the Mind</i> diverted<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">3</a>, and
in as easy and cheerful a state as possible.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="8"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8"></a></span></p>

<p>Somewhat such a system is followed
at the fashionable watering places&mdash;and
great would be the improvement of Health
that would result from it,&mdash;if it was not
continually counteracted, by visits to the
Ball Room<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">4</a> and the Card Table.</p>

<p>A residence in the Country will avail
little, if you carry with you there, the irregular
habits, and late hours of fashionable
Life.</p>

<p>Do not expect much benefit from mere
change of <i>Air</i>&mdash;the purest breezes of the
country will produce very little effect, unless
accompanied by plenty of regular <i>Exercise</i><a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">5</a><span class="pagenum" title="9"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9"></a></span>&mdash;<i>Temperance</i>&mdash;and,
above all, <i>Tranquillity
of Mind</i>.&mdash;See <i>Obs. on</i> &ldquo;<span class="smcap"><a href="#AIR">Air</a></span>&rdquo; and &ldquo;<span class="smcap"><a href="#EXERCISE">Exercise</a></span>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The following is a brief sketch of the
usual <span class="smcap">Method of Training Persons
for Athletic Exercises</span>.</p>

<p>The Alimentary Canal<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">6</a> is cleansed by
<span class="pagenum" title="10"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10"></a></span>an Emetic, and then two or three Purgatives.&mdash;See
<i><a href="#Purgatives">Index</a></i>.</p>

<p>They are directed to eat Beef and Mutton<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">7</a>&mdash;rather
<i>under</i>, than <i>over</i>-done, and without
either Seasoning or Sauce&mdash;<i>Broils</i>,
(No. 94), are preferred to either <i>Roasts</i>
(No. 19), or <i>Boils</i>&mdash;and stale Bread or
Biscuit.</p>

<p>Neither Veal&mdash;Lamb&mdash;Pork&mdash;Fish&mdash;Milk&mdash;Butter&mdash;Cheese&mdash;Puddings&mdash;Pastry&mdash;or
Vegetables, are allowed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="11"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11"></a></span></p>

<p>Beef and Mutton only (fresh, not salted)
are ordered;&mdash;but we believe this restriction
is seldom entirely submitted to.</p>

<p>Nothing tends more to renovate the
Constitution, than a temporary retirement
to the Country.</p>

<p>The necessity of breathing a pure Air,
and the strictest Temperance, are uniformly
and absolutely insisted upon by all Trainers;&mdash;the
striking advantages resulting therefrom,
we have heard as universally acknowledged
by those who have been trained.</p>

<p><i>Mild Home-brewed Ale</i> is recommended
for Drink&mdash;about three pints per day&mdash;taken
with Breakfast and Dinner, and a
little at Supper&mdash;not in large draughts&mdash;but
by mouthfuls, alternately with your food.</p>

<p><i>Stale Beer</i> often disturbs delicate Bowels&mdash;if
your Palate warns you that Malt Liquor
is inclined to be hard, neutralize it with a
little <i>Carbonate of Potash</i>;&mdash;that good
sound Beer, which is neither nauseous from
its newness, nor noxious from its staleness,<span class="pagenum" title="12"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12"></a></span>
is in unison with the animating diet of
Animal Food, which we are recommending
as the most effective antidote to debility,
&amp;c. experience has sufficiently proved.&mdash;There
can be no doubt, that the combination
of the tonic power of the Hop, and
the nourishment of the Malt, is much more
invigorating than any simple vinous spirit,&mdash;but
the difficulty of obtaining it good,
ready brewed&mdash;and the trouble of Brewing
is so great&mdash;that happy are those who are
contented with Good Toast and Water
(No. 463*), as a diluent to solid food&mdash;and
a few glasses of wine as a finishing &ldquo;<i>Bonne
Bouche</i>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Those who do not like Beer&mdash;are allowed
Wine and Water&mdash;Red wine is preferred to
White, and <i>not more</i> than half a pint, (<i>i. e.</i>
eight ounces), or four common sized wine
glasses, after Dinner&mdash;none after Supper&mdash;nor
any Spirits, however diluted.</p>

<p>Eight hours&rsquo; <i>Sleep</i> are necessary&mdash;but
this is generally left to the previous habits<span class="pagenum" title="13"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13"></a></span>
of the Person; those who take active Exercise,
require adequate Rest.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Breakfast</span><a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">8</a> upon meat at eight o&rsquo;clock<span class="pagenum" title="14"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14"></a></span>&mdash;<span class="smcap">Dinner</span>
at two&mdash;<span class="smcap">Supper</span> is not advised,
but they may have a little bit of cold meat
about eight o&rsquo;clock, and take a walk after,
between it and ten, when they go to Bed.</p>

<p><i>The Time requisite to screw a Man up to
his fullest Strength</i>, depends upon his previous
habits and Age. In the Vigour of
Life, between 20 and 35, a Month or two is
generally sufficient:&mdash;more or less, according
as he is older, and as his previous Habits
have been in opposition to the above system.</p>

<p>By this mode of proceeding for two or
three months&mdash;the Constitution of the human<span class="pagenum" title="15"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15"></a></span>
frame is greatly improved, and the Courage
proportionately increased,&mdash;a person who
was breathless, and panting on the least
exertion&mdash;and had a certain share of those
Nervous and Bilious Complaints, which are
occasionally the companions of all who reside
in great Cities&mdash;becomes enabled to
run with ease and fleetness.</p>

<p>The Restorative Process having proceeded
with healthful regularity&mdash;every
part of the Constitution is effectively invigorated&mdash;a
Man feels so conscious of
the actual augmentation of all his powers,
both Bodily and Mental, that he will undertake
with alacrity&mdash;a task which before he
shrunk from encountering.</p>

<p>The clearness of <span class="smcap">the Complexion</span> is
considered the <i>best criterion of a Man&rsquo;s being
in good condition</i>&mdash;to which we add the
appearance of the <span class="smcap">Under-Lip</span>&mdash;which is
plump and rosy, in proportion to the healthy
plethora of the constitution:&mdash;this is a much
more certain symptom of vigorous Health<span class="pagenum" title="16"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16"></a></span>
than any indication you can form from the
appearance of the Tongue&mdash;or the <span class="smcap">Pulse</span>,
which is another very uncertain and deceiving
Index,&mdash;the strength and frequency of which,
not only varies in different persons, but in
the same person in different circumstances
and positions;&mdash;in some Irritable Constitutions
<i>the vibration of the Heart varies almost
as often as it Beats</i>&mdash;when we walk&mdash;stand&mdash;sit&mdash;or
lie down&mdash;early in the
morning&mdash;late in the evening&mdash;elated with
good news&mdash;depressed by bad, &amp;c.&mdash;when
the Stomach is empty&mdash;after taking food&mdash;after
a full meal of Nutritive food&mdash;after a
spare one of <i>Maigre materials</i>. Moreover, it
is impossible to ascertain the degree of deviation
from Health by feeling a Pulse&mdash;unless
we are well acquainted with the peculiarity
of it, when the patient is in Health.</p>

<p>The Editor has now arrived at the most
difficult part of his work, and needs all the
assistance that Training can give, to excite
him to proceed with any hope of developing<span class="pagenum" title="17"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17"></a></span>
the subject, with that perspicuity and effect&mdash;which
it deserves, and he desires to
give it.</p>

<p>The <i>Food</i>&mdash;<i>Clothes</i>&mdash;<i>Fire</i>&mdash;<i>Air</i>&mdash;<i>Exercise</i>&mdash;<i>Sleep</i>&mdash;<i>Wine</i>,
&amp;c. which may
be most advisable for invigorating the
Health of one individual&mdash;may be by no
means the best adapted to produce a like
good effect with another;&mdash;at the time of
Life most people arrive at, before they think
about these things&mdash;they are often become
the slaves of habits which have grown with
their growth, and strengthened with their
strength&mdash;and the utmost that can be done
after our 40th year, is to endeavour very
gradually to correct them.</p>

<p>We caution those who are past the Meridian
of Life (see <i><a href="#Meridian">Index</a></i>)&mdash;to beware of suddenly
abandoning established Customs, (especially
of diminishing the warmth of their Clothing,
or the nutritive quality of what they Eat<span class="pagenum" title="18"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18"></a></span>
and Drink), which, by long usage, often
become as indispensable, as a Mathematical
Valetudinarian reckoned his Flannel Waistcoat
was&mdash;&ldquo;in the <i>ratio</i> that my <i>Body</i>
would be uncomfortable without my <i>Skin</i>&mdash;would
my <i>Skin</i> be, without my <i>Flannel
Waistcoat</i>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>We recommend those who are in search
of Health and Strength, to read the remarks
which are classed under the titles <span class="smcap">Wine</span>,&mdash;<span class="smcap">Siesta</span>,&mdash;<span class="smcap">Clothes</span>,&mdash;&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Air</span>&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Fire</span>&rdquo;&mdash;<span class="smcap">Sleep</span>&mdash;<span class="smcap">Peptic
Precepts</span>, &amp;c.</p>

<p>With the greatest deference, we submit
the following sketch, to be variously modified
by the Medical Adviser&mdash;according to the
season of the Year&mdash;the Age&mdash;Constitution&mdash;and
previous habits of the Patient,&mdash;the
purpose it is intended to accomplish&mdash;or
the Disorder it is intended to prevent or
cure.</p>

<p>The first thing to be done, is to put the
Principal Viscera into a condition to absorb
the <i>pabulum vit√¶</i>, we put into the Stomach<span class="pagenum" title="19"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19"></a></span>&mdash;as
much depends on the state of the
Organs of Digestion<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">9</a> as on the quality of
our Diet:&mdash;therefore commence with taking,
early in the morning, fasting, about half an
hour before Breakfast, about two drams of
<i>Epsom Salts</i> (<i>i. e.</i> as much as will move the
Bowels twice, not more,) in half a pint of
warm water.&mdash;See <i><a href="#Epsom_Salt">Index</a></i>.</p>

<p>The following day, go into a <i>Tepid Bath</i>,
heated to about 95 degrees of <i>Fahrenheit</i>.</p>

<p>The Third day, take another dose of
Salts&mdash;keeping to a light diet of Fish&mdash;Broths,
&amp;c. (Nos. 490, 563, 564, and 572).
During the next week, take the <span class="smcap">Tonic
Tincture</span>, as directed in (No. 569). See
<i><a href="#Tincture">Index</a></i>. Thus far&mdash;any person may proceed
without any difficulty,&mdash;and great benefit
will he derive therefrom, if he cannot pursue
the following part of the System:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="20"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20"></a></span>
<span class="smcap">Rise</span> early&mdash;if the Weather permits,
amuse yourself with Exercise in the open
air for some time before <span class="smcap">Breakfast</span>&mdash;the
material for which, I leave entirely to the
previous habit of the Individual.</p>

<p>Such is the sensibility of the Stomach,
when recruited by a good night&rsquo;s rest,
that of all alterations in Diet, it will be
most disappointed at any change of this
Meal&mdash;either of the time it is taken&mdash;or of
the quantity, or quality of it&mdash;so much so,
that the functions of a delicate Stomach
will be frequently deranged throughout the
whole Day after.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Breakfast</span> I recommend, is Good
Milk Gruel (No. 572), see <i><a href="#Gruel">Index</a></i>, or Beef Tea
(No. 563), see <i><a href="#Tea">Index</a></i>, or Portable Beef Tea
(No. 252); a pint of the latter may be made
for two-pence halfpenny, as easily as a
Basin of Gruel.</p>

<p>The interval between <i>Breakfast</i> and <i>Eleven</i>
o&rsquo;clock, is the best time for Intellectual business&mdash;then
<i>Exercise</i> again till about <i>Twelve</i>&mdash;when<span class="pagenum" title="21"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21"></a></span>
probably the Appetite will be craving
for a <span class="smcap">Luncheon</span>, which may consist of a
bit of roasted Poultry,&mdash;a basin of good
Beef Tea, or Eggs poached, (No. 546), or
boiled in the Shell, (No. 547), Fish plainly
dressed, (No. 144, or 145, &amp;c.), or a Sandwich
(No. 504),&mdash;stale Bread&mdash;and half a
pint of good Home-brewed Beer&mdash;or Toast
and Water, (No. 463*),&mdash;see <i><a href="#Toast_and_Water">Index</a></i>,&mdash;with
about one-fourth or one-third part of its
measure of Wine, of which Port is preferred.</p>

<p>The solidity of the <span class="smcap">Luncheon</span> should
be proportionate to the time it is intended
to enable you to wait for your Dinner, and
the activity of the Exercise you take in the
mean-time.</p>

<p>Take Exercise and Amusement as much
as is convenient in the open air again, till
past Four&mdash;then rest, and prepare for <span class="smcap">Dinner</span>
at <i>Five</i>&mdash;which should be confined to
One Dish, of roasted Beef (No. 19), or
Mutton (No. 23), five days in the week&mdash;boiled
meat one&mdash;and roasted Poultry one&mdash;with<span class="pagenum" title="22"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22"></a></span>
a portion of sufficiently boiled ripe
Vegetables&mdash;mashed Potatoes are preferred,
see (No. 106), and the other fourteen ways
of dressing this useful root.</p>

<p>The same restrictions from other articles
of Food<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">10</a>, as we have already mentioned in
the plan for Training&mdash;<i>i. e.</i> if the person
trained&mdash;has not arrived at that time of Life,
when habit has become so strong&mdash;that to
deprive him of those accustomed Indulgencies,
&amp;c. by which his health has hitherto
been supported&mdash;would be as barbarous&mdash;as
to take away Crutches from the
Lame.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="23"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23"></a></span>
<span class="smcap">Drink</span> at Dinner, a pint of home-brewed
Beer, or Toast and Water (No. 463*), with
one-third or one-fourth part Wine, and a
few glasses of Wine after&mdash;the less, the
better&mdash;but take as much as custom has
made necessary to excite that degree of
circulation in your system, without which,
you are uncomfortable. Read <i>Obs. on</i>
&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Wine</span>.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">After Dinner</span> sit quiet for a couple of
hours&mdash;the <i>Semi-Siesta</i> is a pleasant position&mdash;<i>i. e.</i>
the Feet on a stool about eight inches
high,&mdash;or if your Exercise has fatigued
you, lie down, and indulge in Horizontal
Refreshment<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">11</a>:&mdash;this you may sometimes do
with advantage before Dinner, if you have
taken more Exercise than usual, and you feel
tired:&mdash;when the Body is fatigued, the
Stomach, by sympathy, will, in proportion,<span class="pagenum" title="24"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24"></a></span>
be incapable of doing its business of
Digestion.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">At Seven</span>, a little Tea, or warmed Milk
with a very little Rum, a bit of Sugar, and a
little Nutmeg in it&mdash;after which, Exercise
and Amusement again, if convenient, in the
open air.</p>

<p>For <span class="smcap">Supper</span>, a Biscuit, or a Sandwich,
(No. 504), or a bit of cold Fowl, &amp;c.
and a glass of Beer, or Wine, and Toast
and Water (No. 463*),&mdash;and occasionally
(No. 572), <i>i. e. as light a Supper as possible</i>&mdash;the
sooner after <i>Ten</i> you retire to
rest, the better.</p>

<p><i>For those who Dine very late</i>&mdash;the best
Supper is Gruel (No. 572), or a little
Bread and Cheese, or Pounded Cheese
(No. 542), and a glass of Beer&mdash;but if You
have had an early, or a <i>Ban Yan Dinner</i>&mdash;or
Instinct suggests that the exhaustion,
from extraordinary exertion, requires more
restorative materials,&mdash;furnish your Stomach
with a Chop or a Chicken, &amp;c. or<span class="pagenum" title="25"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25"></a></span>
some of the easily digestible and nutritive
materials referred to in the <i>Index</i> under
the article <i>Food for Feeble Stomachs</i>&mdash;and
as much diffusible stimulus as will animate
the Circulation, and ensure the influence
of &ldquo;Nature&rsquo;s sweet restorer, Balmy
Sleep,&rdquo;&mdash;the soundness of which,&mdash;depends
entirely on the Stomach being in
good temper, and the Heart supporting the
circulation with Salutary Vigour. See the
<i>Art of Sleeping</i>.&mdash;<i><a href="#SLEEP">Index</a></i>.</p>

<p>For the Diet to be confined to Beef and
Mutton, is a sufficient abridgment of the
amusements of the Mouth&mdash;it is a barbarous
mortification, to insist on these
being always cooked the same way<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">12</a>, and
<span class="pagenum" title="26"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26"></a></span>we advise an occasional indulgence in
the whole range of plain Cookery, from
(No. 1) to (No. 98).</p>

<p><i>Broils</i> (No. 94) are ordered in the plan
for Training, probably, because the most
convenient manner of obtaining the desired
portion <i>Hot</i>,&mdash;(Food is then most easy of
Digestion&mdash;<i>before the process of Digestion
can commence, it must take the temperature of
the Stomach</i>&mdash;which, when in a languid state,
has no superfluous Heat to spare&mdash;) but as
the Lean part is often scorched and dried,
and the Fat becomes empyreumatic, from
being in immediate contact with the Fire&mdash;a
slice of well roasted Ribs (No. 20),&mdash;or
Sir Loin of Beef (No. 19), or a Leg, Neck,
Loin, or Saddle of Mutton (No. 23, or 26,
or 31), must be infinitely more succulent
and nutritive&mdash;whether this be rather <i>over</i>,
or <i>under</i>-done, the previous habits of the
Eater must determine&mdash;the Medium, between
<i>over</i> and <i>under</i>-dressing&mdash;is in general
most Agreeable, and certainly most Wholesome.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="27"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27"></a></span>
That <i>Meat</i> which is considerably <i>under</i>-done,
contains more Nutriment than that
which is <i>over</i>-done, is true enough;&mdash;that
which is <i>not done at all</i>, contains a great
deal more&mdash;but, in the ratio that it is <i>Raw</i><a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">13</a>,
so is it unfortunately difficult of digestion,
as <i>Spallanzani</i> (see <i><a href="#Spallanzani">Index</a></i>) has proved by
actual and satisfactory experiments.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Our Food must be done</span>&mdash;<i>either by our
Cook,&mdash;or by our Stomach</i>,&mdash;before Digestion
can take place&mdash;(see 1st page of <i>Obs.</i>
on <i><a href="#THE_SIESTA">Siesta</a></i>); surely no man in his senses,
would willingly be so wanting in consideration
of the comfort, &amp;c. of his Stomach, as to
give it the needless trouble of Cooking and
Digesting also&mdash;and waste its valuable energies
in work which a Spit or a Stewpan can
do better.</p>

<p>Thoroughly dressed <span class="smcap">Beef</span> (No. 19), or<span class="pagenum" title="28"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28"></a></span>
<span class="smcap">Mutton</span> (No. 23), is incomparably the most
animating Food we can furnish our Stomachs
with, and sound <span class="smcap">Home-brewed Beer</span>,
the most invigorating Drink&mdash;It is indeed,
Gentle Reader, notwithstanding a foolish
fashion has banished the natural beverage
of Great Britain&mdash;as extremely ungenteel.&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;Your Wine tippling, Dram sipping fellows retreat,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But your Beer-drinking Briton can never be beat.&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p><i>The best Tests of the Restorative qualities
of Food</i>&mdash;are a small quantity of it satisfying
Hunger,&mdash;the strength of the Pulse
after it,&mdash;and the length of Time which
elapses before Appetite returns again:&mdash;according
to these Rules, the Editor&rsquo;s own
experience gives a decided verdict in favour
of Roasted or Broiled Beef (No. 19 or 94),
or Mutton (No. 26 or 23), as most nutritive,&mdash;then
Game and Poultry, of which the
meat is Brown, (No. 59, or 61, or 74),
next Veal and Lamb and Poultry, of which
the meat is White&mdash;the Fat kinds of Fish,<span class="pagenum" title="29"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29"></a></span>
Eels&mdash;Salmon&mdash;Herrings, &amp;c. and least
nutritive, the white kinds of Fish&mdash;such as
Whiting, Cod, Soles, Haddocks, &amp;c. For
further information, see <i>Oysters</i>, (No. 181).</p>

<p>The celebrated Trainer, Sir Thomas Parkyns,
&amp;c., &ldquo;greatly preferred <span class="smcap">Beef-eaters</span>&mdash;to
<i>Sheep-biters</i>, as they called those who
ate Mutton.&rdquo;</p>

<p>By <span class="smcap">Dr. Stark&rsquo;s</span> <i>very curious Experiments
on Diet</i>, p. 110, it appears, that
&ldquo;when he fed upon <i>Roasted Goose</i>, he was
much more vigorous both in Body and Mind,
than with any other food.&rdquo;</p>

<p>That <i>Fish</i> is less nutritive than <span class="smcap">Flesh</span>&mdash;the
speedy return of Hunger after a dinner
of Fish is sufficient proof&mdash;when a Trainer
at Newmarket<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">14</a> wishes <i>to waste a Jockey</i>&mdash;he
is not allowed <i>Pudding</i>, if Fish can be
had.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="30"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30"></a></span>
Crabs,&mdash;Lobsters (No. 176), Prawns, &amp;c.
unless thoroughly boiled, (which those sold
ready boiled seldom are), are tremendously
indigestible.</p>

<p><i>Shell Fish</i> have long held a high rank
in the catalogue of easily digestible and
speedily restorative Foods:&mdash;of these
<i>Oysters</i> (No. 181), certainly deserve the
best character; but we think that they,
as well as <i>Eggs</i>,&mdash;<i>Gelatinous Substances</i>,&mdash;<i>Rich
Broths</i><a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">15</a>, &amp;c. have acquired not a
little more reputation for these qualities
than they deserve.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Oysters</span> are often cold and uncomfortable
to Dyspeptic Stomachs&mdash;unless<span class="pagenum" title="31"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31"></a></span>
warmed with a certain quantity of Pepper,
and good White Wine.</p>

<p><i>To recruit the Animal Spirits, and produce
Strength</i>, there is nothing like <span class="smcap">Beef</span> and
<span class="smcap">Mutton</span>&mdash;moreover, when kept till properly
tender, none will give less trouble to
the Digestive organs&mdash;and more substantial
excitement to the Constitution.</p>

<p>The Editor has dined for some years principally
upon plainly roasted or boiled Beef
and Mutton, and has often observed, that
if he changes it for any other Food for
several days together&mdash;that he suffers a
diminution of strength, &amp;c. and is disposed
on such days to drink an additional Glass
of <i>Wine</i>, &amp;c. See <i><a href="#glass_of_Wine">Index</a></i>.</p>

<p>However, the fitness of various Foods,
and Drinks&mdash;and the quantity of Nutriment
which they afford&mdash;depends very
much upon how they are prepared, and
as much on the inclination and abilities
of the concoctive faculties, which have the
task of converting them into Chyle.</p>

<p>It is quite as absurd, to suppose, that one<span class="pagenum" title="32"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32"></a></span>
kind of Diet, &amp;c. is equally adapted to every
kind of Constitution&mdash;as that one Remedy
will cure all Diseases.</p>

<p><i>To produce the highest degree of Health
and Strength</i>&mdash;we must supply the Stomach
with not merely that material which contains
the greatest quantity of Nourishment&mdash;but
in making our reckoning, must take
into the account, the degree in which it is
adapted to the habits and powers of the
Organ which is to digest it&mdash;the Arms of
a Giant are of little use in the Hands of a
Dwarf.</p>

<p><i>The Plan we have proposed, was calculated
for Midsummer-day</i>,&mdash;when plenty of
hard Exercise in the open Air will soon
create an Appetite for the substantial Diet
we have recommended&mdash;it is taken for
granted, that a Person has the opportunity
of devoting a couple of months to the re-establishment
of his Health&mdash;and that during
that time, he will be content to consider
himself in the same state as any other
Animal out of condition&mdash;and disposed to<span class="pagenum" title="33"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33"></a></span>
submit cheerfully to such a modification of
the rules recommended, as his Medical
Adviser may deem most convenient to the
circumstances of the Case, and the Age, the
Constitution, and previous habits of the
Patient, &amp;c. &amp;c.</p>

<p><i>Every part of this system must be observed
in proportion</i>&mdash;and <span class="smcap">Exercise</span> increased
in the same degree, that <span class="smcap">Nourishment</span>
is introduced to the Constitution.</p>

<p><i>The best General Rule for Diet</i> that I can
write, is to Eat and Drink only of such
Foods&mdash;at such times,&mdash;and in such quantities&mdash;as
Experience has convinced you,
agree with your Constitution&mdash;and absolutely
to avoid all other.</p>

<p>A very different Regimen must be observed
by those who live a Life with Labour&mdash;or
Exercise&mdash;or of Indolence,&mdash;and at
the different Periods of Life.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Human Life</span> may be divided into <i>Three
Stages</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="34"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34"></a></span>
The <span class="smcap">First</span>, <i>The period of Preparation</i> from
our birth, till about our 21st year, when the
Body has generally attained the <i>acm√©</i> of
expansion:&mdash;till then, a continual and copious
supply of Chyle is necessary, not only
to keep our machinery in repair, but to
furnish material for the increase of it.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Second</span> from 21 to 42, <i>The period
of Active Usefulness</i>; during which, nothing
more is wanted, than to restore the daily
waste, occasioned by the actions of the Vital
and Animal Functions.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Third</span>, <i>The period of Decline</i>: this
comes on and proceeds with more or less
celerity, according to the original strength
of the Constitution, and the Economy<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">16</a> with
which it has been managed during the second
period. (Age is a relative term,&mdash;one man is
as old at 40 as another is at 60): but after<span class="pagenum" title="35"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35"></a></span>
42, the most vigorous become gradually more
passive<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">17</a>&mdash;and after 63, pretty nearly quite
so.</p>

<i>The most common cause of Dyspeptic Disorders</i>,
which are so prevalent at the commencement
of the Third Period of Life&mdash;is
an increasing indolence, inducing us to
diminish the degree of the active Exercise
we have been in the habit of taking&mdash;without
in a corresponding degree diminishing
the quantity of our Food&mdash;on the contrary,
people seem to expect the Stomach to grow
stronger and to work harder as it gets Older,
and to almost entirely support the Circulation
without the help of Exercise.&mdash;</p>

<p>As the activity of our existence&mdash;and the
accommodating powers of the Stomach, &amp;c.
diminish&mdash;in like degree&mdash;must we lessen
the quantity&mdash;and be careful of the quality
of our Food, eat oftener and less at a time&mdash;or
Indigestion&mdash;and the multitude of Disorders
of which it is the fruitful parent,
will soon destroy us.</p>

<p>The System of <span class="smcap">Cornaro</span> has been oftener
quoted, than understood&mdash;most people imagine,
it was one of rigid Abstinence and<span class="pagenum" title="39"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39"></a></span>
comfortless Self-denial&mdash;but this was not
the case:&mdash;his Code of Longevity consisted
in steadily obeying the suggestions of
Instinct&mdash;and Economizing his Vitality, and
living under his income of Health,&mdash;carefully
regulating his temper&mdash;and cultivating
cheerful habits.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The following is a Compendium of
his plan</span>&mdash;<i>in his own words</i>.</p>

<p>He tells us that <i>when Fourscore</i></p>

<p>&ldquo;I am used to take in all twelve ounces
of solid nourishment, such as Meat, and the
yolk of an Egg, &amp;c. and fourteen ounces of
drink:&mdash;I eat Bread, Soup, New-laid Eggs,
Veal, Kid, Mutton, Partridge, Pullets,
Pigeons, &amp;c. and some Sea and River Fish.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I made choice of such Wines and Meats
as agreed with my Constitution, and declined
all other diet&mdash;and proportioned the quantity
thereof to the strength of my Stomach, and
abridged my Food&mdash;as my years increased.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Every one is the best judge of the food
which is most agreeable to his own Stomach,&mdash;it<span class="pagenum" title="40"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40"></a></span>
is next to impossible, to judge what is
best for another;&mdash;the Constitutions of men
are as different from each other as their
complexions.&rdquo;&mdash;p. 36.</p>

<p>&ldquo;1st. Take care of the quality.</p>

<p>&ldquo;2dly. Of the quantity&mdash;so as to eat
and drink nothing that offends the Stomach,
nor any more than you can easily digest:
your experience ought to be your guide in
these two principles when you arrive at
<i>Forty</i>: by that time you ought to know that
you are in the midst of your life; thanks to
the goodness of your Constitution which has
carried you so far: but that when you are
arrived to this period, you go down the hill
apace&mdash;and it is necessary for you to change
your course of life, especially with regard to
the quantity and quality of your diet&mdash;because
it is on that, the health and length
of our days do radically depend. Lastly; if
the former part of our lives has been
altogether sensual&mdash;the latter ought to be
rational and regular; order being necessary<span class="pagenum" title="41"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41"></a></span>
for the preservation of all things, especially
the life of man.&mdash;Longevity cannot be
attained without continence and sobriety<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">18</a>.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;At <i>thirty</i> Man suspects himself a Fool,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Knows it at <i>forty</i>, and reforms his plan.&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>By the small quantity of Food, and great
proportion of his Meat to his Drink, this
noble Venetian, at the age of <i>forty</i>, freed
himself, by the advice of his Physicians,
from several grievous disorders contracted
by intemperance, and lived in health of body,
and great cheerfulness of mind, to above an
hundred.&mdash;Briefly, the secret of his Longevity
seems to have been, a gradually
increasing Temperance &ldquo;in omnibus&rdquo;&mdash;and
probably, after a certain time of Life, abstinence
from the &ldquo;opus magnum.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="42"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42"></a></span>

<p><i>Intensive Life</i>, can only be purchased at
the price of <i>Extensive</i>.</p>

<p>If you force the Heart to gallop as
fast during the second, as it does during the
first stage of life&mdash;and make the steady fire
of 42, to blaze as brightly as the flame of
21,&mdash;it will very soon be burnt out.</p>

<p>Those who cannot be content to submit
to that diminution of action ordained by
nature, against which there is no appeal,&mdash;as
it is the absolute covenant, by the most
attentive and implicit observance of which
we can only hope to hold our lease of life
comfortably,&mdash;will soon bring to the diminished
energy of the Second Stage of Life&mdash;the
Paralysis of the Third.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="43"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43"></a></span>
From 40 to 60, a witty French author
tells us, is &ldquo;<i>La belle saison<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">19</a> pour la Gourmandise</i>;&rdquo;&mdash;for
the artificial pleasures of the
Palate, it may be, and the <i>Bon Vivant</i>
cultivates them as the means of prolonging
the vigour of Youth&mdash;and procrastinating
the approach of Age.</p>

<p>Restoration may certainly be considerably
facilitated, by preparing and dressing food
so as to render it easily soluble&mdash;if the
secret of Rejuvenization be ever discovered;
it will be found in the Kitchen.</p>

<p>Very soon after we pass the <i>Meridian of
Life</i>, (which, according to those who train
men for athletic exercises, and to Dr. Jameson,<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">20</a>
is our 28th, and to Dr. Cheyne, about<span class="pagenum" title="44"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44"></a></span>
our 35th year,) the elasticity of the Animal
System imperceptibly diminishes,&mdash;our
Senses become less susceptible, and are
every hour getting the worse for wear, however
Self-Love, assisted by your Hair-dresser,
and Tailor, &amp;c. may endeavour to
persuade you to the contrary.</p>

<p>Digestion and Sleep are less perfect&mdash;the
restorative process more and more fails to
keep pace with the consuming process&mdash;the
body is insufficiently repaired, more easily
deranged, and with more difficulty brought
into adjustment again; till at length the
vital power being diminished, and the organs
deteriorated,&mdash;Nourishment can neither be
received, or prepared and diffused through
the constitution&mdash;and Consumption so much
exceeds Renovation, that decay rapidly closes
the scene of Life.</p>

<p class="pretable">One may form some Idea of <i>the Self-consumption
of the human body</i>, by reflecting
that the pulsation of the Heart, and the mo<span class="pagenum" title="45"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45"></a></span>tion
of the Blood connected with it, takes place

What Machine, of the most adamantine
material, will not soon be the worse for
wear, from such incessant vibration&mdash;especially
if the Mainsprings of it are not preserved
in a state of due regulation?</p>

<p>The generative faculties, which are the
last that Nature finishes&mdash;are the first
that fail.&mdash;Economy in the exercise of them&mdash;especially
before and after the second
period of Life&mdash;is the grand precept for the
restoration and accumulation of Strength,
the preservation of Health, and the prolongation
of Life;&mdash;we are vigorous, in proportion
to the perfection of the performance
of the Restorative process, <i>i. e.</i> as we Eat
hearty, and Sleep soundly&mdash;as our Body
loses the power of renovating itself, in like
ratio, fails its faculty of creating&mdash;what may
be a salutary subduction of the superfluous
health of the Second&mdash;during the Third
period of life, will be a destructive sacrifice
of the strength of both the Mind and the
Body.&mdash;See also the 9th chapter of the <i>First</i>
Edition of <span class="smcap">Willich</span> <i>on Diet</i>. 8vo. 1799.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="47"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47"></a></span>
The next organical defect, (we perceive
too plainly for our self-love to mistake it,)
is manifested by <span class="smcap">the Eye</span><a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">22</a>. To read a
small print&mdash;you must remove it from the
Eye further than you have been accustomed
to do&mdash;and place it in a better light.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Falsetto</span> Voice now begins to fail,
and <span class="smcap">the Ear</span> loses some of its quickness&mdash;several
extraordinary Musicians have been
able till then, if a handful of the keys of a
Harpsichord were put down so as to produce
the most irrelative combinations&mdash;to name
each half note without a mistake.&mdash;When I
mentioned this to that excellent Organ
Player, Mr. Charles Wesley, he said, &ldquo;At
the age of twenty, I could do it myself&mdash;but
I can&rsquo;t now.&rdquo; He was then in his 55th
year.</p>

<p>About the same time, the Palate is no
longer contented with being employed as a<span class="pagenum" title="48"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48"></a></span>
mere shovel to the Stomach,&mdash;and as it finds
its master becomes every day more difficult
to please&mdash;learns to be a more watchful
Purveyor.</p>

<p>After 40,&mdash;the strongest People begin to
talk about being <i>Bilious</i>, or <i>Nervous</i>, &amp;c. &amp;c.
and the Stomach will no longer do its duty
properly&mdash;unless the Food offered to it is
perfectly agreeable to it&mdash;when offended,
<i>Indigestion</i> brings with it, all that melancholy
depression of the Animal Spirits, which
disables a Man from either thinking with
precision, or acting with vigour&mdash;during the
distressing suspension of the restorative process&mdash;arise
all those miseries of Mind and
Body, which drive Fools to get drunk, and
make Madmen commit suicide:&mdash;without
due attention to Diet, &amp;c. the Third period
of Life is little better than a Chronic
Disease.</p>

<p>As our assimilating powers become enfeebled,
we must endeavour to entertain
them with food so prepared, as to give<span class="pagenum" title="49"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49"></a></span>
them the least trouble, and the most nourishment<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">23</a>.</p>

<p>In the proportion that our Food is restorative,
and properly digested&mdash;our bodies are
preserved in Health and Strength&mdash;and
all our faculties continue vigorous and
perfect.</p>

<p>If it is unwholesome, ill-prepared, and indigestible&mdash;the
Body languishes, and is
exhausted even in its youth&mdash;its strength and
faculties daily decrease, and it sinks beneath
the weight of the painful sensations attendant
on a state of Decay.</p>

<p>Would to Heaven that a Cook could
help our Stomachs, as much as an Optician
can our Eyes: our Existence would
be as much more perfect than it now
is, as our Sight is superior to our other
Senses.</p>

Facts.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 80%">
30 January, 1821.
</p>

<p class="in2em">
MY DEAR SIR,
</p>

<p>In consequence of the Conversation I
had with you, upon the advantages I
had derived from Exercise and attention to
Diet in the reduction of Weight, and your
desire that I should communicate as far as I
recollect them, the particulars of my Case;
I have great pleasure in forwarding to you
the following Statement.</p>

<p>I measure in height six Feet and half
an Inch,&mdash;possess a sound Constitution
and considerable activity.&mdash;At <i>the age of</i><span class="pagenum" title="51"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51"></a></span>
<i>Thirty</i> I weighed about 18 Stone&mdash;two years
afterwards I had reached the great weight of
nineteen Stone, in perfect Health, always
sleeping well and enjoying good Appetite
and Spirits&mdash;soon after, however, I began
to experience the usual attendants on fullness
of Habit, a disinclination to rise in the
morning from drowsiness, heaviness about
the Forehead after I had risen, and a disposition
to Giddiness;&mdash;I was also attacked
by a complaint in one of my Eyes, the Symptoms
of which it is unnecessary to describe,
but it proved to be occasioned by fullness of
blood, as it was removed by cupping in
the temple. I lost four ounces of blood from
the temple; and thinking that the loss of
a little more might be advantageous, I had
eight ounces taken from the back; and in
order to prevent the necessity, as far as possible,
of future bleeding, I resolved to reduce
the system&mdash;by increasing my Exercise and
diminishing my Diet.</p>

<p>I therefore took an early opportunity of
seeing Mr. Jackson, (whose respectability<span class="pagenum" title="52"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52"></a></span>
and skill as a teacher of sparring is universally
acknowledged,) and after some
Conversation with him, determined upon
acting under his Advice.</p>

<p>I accordingly commenced <i>Sparring</i>, having
provided myself with flannel Dresses, which
I always used, being extremely careful on
changing them to avoid the risk of cold, and
I recollect no instance in which I was not
successful.</p>

<p>I also had recourse to <i>Riding</i> Schools,
riding without stirrups, so as to have the
advantage of the most powerful exercise the
Horse could give;&mdash;these exercises I took
in the morning in the proportion probably of
sparring twice a week, and riding three or
four times.</p>

<p>Frequently at night I resumed my Exercise,&mdash;<i>Walking</i>
and sometimes <i>Running</i>,
generally performing about five miles an
hour, till I again produced perspiration;
every other Opportunity I could resort to
of bodily exercise I also availed myself of.</p>

<p>In respect to diet, I had accustomed myself<span class="pagenum" title="53"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53"></a></span>
to Suppers and drinking excellent Table
Beer in large quantities, and for probably ten
Years, had indulged myself with Brandy and
Water after Supper:&mdash;this practice I entirely
discontinued, substituting Toast and
Water with my Dinner, and Tea and a good
allowance of Toast for Supper, always avoiding
copious Draughts.</p>

<p>I left off drinking malt Liquor as a habit,
and indeed, very seldom drank it at all.&mdash;I
took somewhat less meat at Dinner, avoiding
Pies and Puddings as much as possible, but
always took three or four Glasses of Port
after dinner.</p>

<p>During the time I was under this training,
I took the opinion of an eminent Physician
upon the subject, who entirely approved
of my Plan, and recommended the occasional
use of Aperient medicine, but which I
seldom resorted to.</p>

<p><i>The Result of all this, was a reduction
of my Weight of upwards of three Stone</i>,
or about Forty-five Pounds, <i>in about six or</i><span class="pagenum" title="54"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54"></a></span>
<i>seven months</i>.&mdash;I found my activity very
much increased, and my wind excellent, but,
I think, my Strength not quite so great,
though I did not experience any material
Reduction of it: my Health was perfect
throughout.</p>

<p>I then relaxed my System a little, and have
up to the present time, being a period of ten
Years, avoided the necessity of bleeding, and
have enjoyed an almost uninterrupted continuance
of good Health, although my Weight
has gradually increased; sometimes, however,
fluctuating between 7 or 8 Pounds and a
Stone, according to my means of Exercise,&mdash;always
increasing in Winter, and losing in
Summer;&mdash;and at this moment (January
29th, 1821,) I am about a Stone more than I
ought to be, having ascertained, that my
best bodily Strength, is at sixteen Stone
and a half.</p>

<p>When the object is <i>to Reduce Weight</i>, rest
and moderate Food will always sufficiently
restore the exhaustion arising from Exercise;&mdash;if<span class="pagenum" title="55"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55"></a></span>
an additional quantity of Food and
nourishing Liquors be resorted to, the Body
will in general be restored to the weight
it was before the Exercise.</p>

<p>I have sometimes lost from ten ounces to
a Pound in weight by an Hour&rsquo;s sparring.
If the object be not to reduce the weight,
the Food may safely be proportioned to the
Exercise.</p>

<p>You will readily perceive, that the plan
I adopted, ought only to be resorted to by
Persons of sound Constitution and of athletic
bodily Frame,&mdash;it would be absurd to
lay down a general rule for the adoption of
all fat men.</p>

<p>I think, with all lusty men, the drinking
of malt Liquor of any kind is injurious,&mdash;Meat
taken more than once
a day is liable to the same Objection.
I still persevere in the disuse of malt Liquors
and Spirits, and Suppers, seldom taking
more than four Glasses of Wine as a
habit,&mdash;although I do not now deem it<span class="pagenum" title="56"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56"></a></span>
necessary to make myself so far the Slave
of habit, as to refuse the Pleasures of the
Table when they offer.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 5em">I am, dear Sir,</p>

<p style="text-indent: 10em">Yours very truly,</p>

<hr class="c20"/>

<p>The following are the most interesting
Facts in Dr. Bryan Robinson&rsquo;s Essay on the
Food and Discharges of the Human Body,
8vo. 1748, which has become scarce.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am now, in <i>May</i> 1747, in the 68th year
of my age. The length of my Body is 63
Inches: I am of a sanguine but not robust
constitution&mdash;and am at present neither
lean nor fat. In the year 1721 the Morning
weight of my body without Clothes, was
about 131 Avoirdupois pounds, the daily
weight of my food at a medium was about
85 Avoirdupois ounces, and the proportion
of my Drink to my Meat, I judge was at that
time about 2.5&mdash;to 1.</p>

<p>&ldquo;At the latter end of <i>May</i> 1744, my weight<span class="pagenum" title="57"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57"></a></span>
was above 164 pounds, and the proportion of
my Drink to my Meat was considerably
greater than before, and had been so for
some time. I was then seized with a Paralytic
disorder, which obliged me to make
an alteration in my diet. In order to settle
the proportion of my Drink to my Meat,
I considered what others have said concerning
this proportion.</p>

<p>&ldquo;According to <i>Sanctorius</i>, though he
reckons it a disproportion, the drink to the

<p>&ldquo;At the age of 64, by lessening my food,
and increasing the proportion of my meat to
my drink, <i>i. e.</i> by lessening my drink about<span class="pagenum" title="58"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58"></a></span>
a third part, (<i>i. e.</i> to 20 ounces) and my
meat about a sixth, (<i>i. e.</i> 38 ounces) of what
they were in 1721, I have freed myself for
these two years past from the returns of a
<i>Sore throat</i> and <i>Diarrh&#339;a</i>,&mdash;Disorders I often
had, though they were but slight, and never
confined me. I have been much more costive
than I was before, when I lived more fully, and
took more Exercise, and have greatly, for my
age, recovered the paralytic weakness I was
seized with three years ago.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hence we gather, that good and constant
Health consists in a just quantity of food;
and a just proportion of the meat to the
drink: and that to be freed from chronical
disorders contracted by Intemperance&mdash;the
quantity of food ought to be lessened; and
the proportion of the meat to the drink
increased&mdash;more or less, according to the
greatness of the disorders, p. 61.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I commonly ate four ounces of Bread
and Butter, and drank half a pound of a very
weak infusion of Green Tea for <i>Breakfast</i>.<span class="pagenum" title="59"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59"></a></span>
For <i>Dinner</i> I took two ounces of Bread,
and the rest Flesh-meat,&mdash;Beef, Mutton,
Pork, Veal, Hare, Rabbit, Goose, Turkey,
Fowl tame and wild, and Fish. I generally
chose the strongest meats as fittest, since
they agreed well with my stomach, to keep
up the power of my body under this great
diminution of my food; I seldom took any
<i>Garden stuff</i>&mdash;finding that it commonly
lessened perspiration and <i>increased my weight</i>.&mdash;I
drank four ounces of water with my
meat and a pound of Claret after I had done
eating. At night I ate nothing, but drank 12
ounces of water with a pipe of Tobacco, p. 63.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is but one Weight, under which a
grown body can enjoy the best and most uninterrupted
Health. p. 91. That Weight is
such as enables the Heart to supply the
several parts of the body with just quantities
of Blood. p. 100.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The weight under which an Animal has the
greatest strength and activity&mdash;which I shall
call its <i>Athletic weight</i>,&mdash;is that weight under<span class="pagenum" title="60"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60"></a></span>
which the Heart&mdash;and the proportion of the
weight of the Heart to the weight of the body
are greatest: the strength of the Muscles is
measured by the strength of the Heart, p. 117.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If the weight of the body of an Animal
be greater than its <i>Athletic Weight</i>, it may
be reduced to that weight by evacuations,
dry food and exercise. These lessen the
weight of the Body, by wasting its fat,
and lessening its Liver; and they increase
the weight of the Heart, by increasing the
quantity and motion of the blood. Thus
a game Cock in ten days is reduced to his
athletic weight, and prepared for fighting.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If the Food, which with Evacuations and
Exercise, reduced the Cock to his athletic
weight in ten days, be continued any longer,
the Cock will not have that strength and
activity which he had before under his
athletic weight; which may be owing to the
loss of weight going on after he arrives at
his athletic weight.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is known by experiment, that a Cock<span class="pagenum" title="61"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61"></a></span>
cannot stand above 24 hours at his athletic
weight, and that a Cock has changed very
much for the worse in 12 hours.</p>

<p>&ldquo;When a Cock is at the top of his condition,
that is, when he is at his athletic weight,
his Head is of a glowing red colour, his Neck
thick, and his Thigh thick and firm;&mdash;the day
after his complexion is less glowing, his Neck
thinner, and his Thigh softer;&mdash;and the third
day his Thigh will be very soft and flaccid.
p. 119.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If the increase of weight in a small
compass of time, rise to above a certain
quantity, it will cause disorders.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can bear an increase of above a pound
and a half in one day, and an increase of three
or four pounds in six or seven days, without
being disordered; but think I should suffer
from an increase of five or six pounds in
that time.</p>

<p>&ldquo;An increase of weight may be carried
off by lessening the Food,&mdash;or by increasing
the Discharges.&mdash;The discharges may be<span class="pagenum" title="62"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62"></a></span>
increased either by exercise, or by evacuations
procured by art.</p>

<p>&ldquo;By lessening the daily quantity of my
food to 23 ounces, I have lost 26 ounces;&mdash;by
fasting a whole day, I lost 48 ounces,
having gained 27 the day before.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. Rye was a strong, well set, corpulent
man, of a sanguine complexion; by a brisk
walk for one hour before breakfast he threw
off, by insensible perspiration, one pound
of increased weight; by a walk of three
hours, he threw off two pounds of increased
weight. The best way to take off an increase
of weight which threatens a distemper, is
either by fasting or exercise. p. 84.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The mean loss of weight by several
grown bodies caused by a purging medicine
composed of a drachm of <i>Jalap</i> and ten
grains of <i>Calomel</i>, was about 2&frac34; Avoirdupois
pounds; and the mean quantity of Liquor,
drank during the time of Purging, was about
double the loss of Weight.&rdquo;&mdash;<span class="smcap">Robinson</span>
<i>on the Animal Economy</i>, p. 458.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="63"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63"></a></span>
&ldquo;I have lost, by a spontaneous <i>Diarrh&#339;a</i>,
two pounds in twenty-four hours; and Mr.
Rye lost twice that quantity in the same
time.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>On the Food and Discharges of
Human Bodies</i>, by <span class="smcap">B. Robinson</span>, p. 84.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Most <i>Chronic Diseases</i>&mdash;arise from too
much <i>Food</i> and too little <i>Exercise</i>,&mdash;both of
which lessen the weight of the Heart and
the quantity of Blood;&mdash;the first by causing
fatness; the second by a diminution of the
blood&rsquo;s motion.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hence, when the <span class="smcap">Liver</span> is grown too
large by Intemperance and Inactivity, it may
be lessened and brought to a healthful magnitude
by Temperance and Exercise.&mdash;It
may be emptied other ways by art; but
nothing can prevent its filling again, and
consequently secure good and constant
Health&mdash;but an exact Diet and Exercise.
Purging and Vomiting may lessen the
Liver, and reduce it to its just magnitude;&mdash;but
these evacuations cannot prevent
its increasing again, so long as persons live<span class="pagenum" title="64"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64"></a></span>
too fully, and use too little exercise&mdash;and
can only be done by lessening the Food
and increasing the Exercise.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Much sleep, much food, and little
exercise, are the principal things which make
animals grow fat. If the Body, on account
of Age or other Infirmities, cannot use sufficient
Exercise, and takes much the same
quantity of Sleep, its weight must be
lessened by lessening the Food, which may
be done by lessening the Drink, without
making any change in the Meat; as I have
proved myself by experience.&rdquo;&mdash;p. 90.</p>

<p>The Debilitated require much more rest
than the Robust:&mdash;nothing is so restorative
to the nerves, as sound, and uninterrupted
Sleep, which is the chief source of both
Bodily and Mental Strength.</p>

<p>The Studious need a full portion of Sleep,
which seems to be as necessary nutriment to
the Brain, as Food is to the Stomach.</p>

<p>Our Strength and Spirits are infinitely
more exhausted by the exercise of our<span class="pagenum" title="67"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67"></a></span>
Mental, than by the labour of our Corporeal
faculties&mdash;let any person try the effect of
<i>Intense Application</i> for a few hours&mdash;He will
soon find how much his Body is fatigued
thereby, although He has not stirred from
the Chair He sat on.</p>

<p>Those who are candidates for Health&mdash;must
be as circumspect in the task they set
their mind,&mdash;as in the exercise they give to
their Body.</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Armstrong</span>, the Poet of Health,
observes,</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis <i>the great Art of</i> <span class="smcap">Life</span> to manage well<br />
The restless Mind.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The grand secret seems to be, to contrive
that the exercise of the Body, and that of
the Mind, may serve as relaxations to each
other.</p>

<p>Over Exertion, or Anxiety of Mind, disturbs
Digestion infinitely more than any
fatigue of Body&mdash;the Brain demands a
much more abundant supply of the Animal<span class="pagenum" title="68"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68"></a></span>
Spirits, than is required for the excitement
of mere Legs and Arms.</p>

<blockquote><p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis the Sword that wears out the Scabbard.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>

<p>Of the two ways of fertilizing the Brain&mdash;by
Sleep, or by Spirituous Stimulus&mdash;(for
some write best in the Morning, others
when wound up with Wine, after Dinner
or Supper:) the former is much less expensive&mdash;and
less injurious to the constitution
than either Port, or Brandy, whose
aid it is said that some of our best Authors
have been indebted to, for their most brilliant
productions.</p>

<p>Calling one day on a literary friend, we
found him reclining on a Sofa&mdash;on expressing
our concern to find him indisposed, he
said, &ldquo;No, I was only <i>hatching</i>,&mdash;I have
been writing till I was quite tired&mdash;my
paper must go to Press to day&mdash;so I was
taking my usual restorative&mdash;<i>A Nap</i>&mdash;which
if it only lasts five minutes, so re<span class="pagenum" title="69"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69"></a></span>freshes
my Mind&mdash;that my Pen goes to
work again spontaneously.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Is it not better <i>Economy of Time</i>, to go
to sleep for half an hour,&mdash;than to go on
noodling all day in a nerveless and semi-superannuated
state&mdash;if not asleep, certainly
not effectively Awake&mdash;for any purpose
requiring the Energy of either the
Body, or the Mind.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>A Forty Winks Nap</i>,&rdquo; in an horizontal
posture, is the best preparative for any
extraordinary exertion of either.</p>

<p>Those who possess, and employ the
powers of the Mind most&mdash;seldom attain the
greatest Age<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">25</a>:&mdash;see <span class="smcap">Brunaud</span> <i>de L&rsquo;Hygiene
des Gens de Lettres, Paris</i>, 8vo. 1819:&mdash;the<span class="pagenum" title="70"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70"></a></span>
Envy their Talent excites,&mdash;the Disappointment
they often meet with in their
expectations of receiving the utmost attention
and respect, (which the world has<span class="pagenum" title="71"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71"></a></span>
seldom the gratitude to pay them while
they live,) keep them in a perpetual state

prematurely to their Grave<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">26</a>.</p>

<p><i>To rest a whole Day</i>&mdash;under great fatigue
of either Body or Mind, is occasionally extremely
beneficial&mdash;it is impossible to regulate
Sleep by the hour;&mdash;when the Mind
and the Body have received all the refreshment
which Sleep can give, people cannot<span class="pagenum" title="72"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72"></a></span>
lie in Bed, and till then, they should not
Rise<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">27</a>.</p>

<p>Our Philosophical Poet here gives the
best practical maxim on the subject for Valetudinarians&mdash;who,
by following his advice,
may render their Existence, instead of a dull
unvaried round of joyless, useless self-denial,&mdash;a
circle of agreeable sensation;&mdash;for instance,
go not to your Bed till You are tired
of sitting up&mdash;then remain in an Horizontal
posture,&mdash;till You long to change it for a
Vertical: thus, by a little management, the
inevitable business of Life may be converted
into a source of continual Enjoyment.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="73"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73"></a></span>
All-healing Sleep soon neutralizes the
corroding caustic of Care&mdash;and blunts even
the barbed arrows of the marble-hearted
Fiend, Ingratitude.</p>

<p>When the Pulse is almost paralysed by
Anxiety,&mdash;half an hour&rsquo;s repose, will cheer
the circulation, restore tranquillity to the
perturbed spirit&mdash;and dissipate those heavy
clouds of <i>Ennui</i>, which sometimes threaten to
eclipse the brightest Minds, and best Hearts.&mdash;Child
of Woe, lay thy Head on thy pillow,
(instead of thy Mouth to the bottle,) and
bless me for directing Thee to the true source
of Lethe&mdash;and most sovereign <i>Nepenth√©</i> for
the Sorrows of Human Life.</p>

<p>The Time requisite to restore the waste
occasioned by the action of the Day&mdash;depends
on the activity of the habits, and
on the Health of the Individual,&mdash;in general
it cannot be less than Seven&mdash;and need not
be more than Nine hours<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">28</a>.</p>

Invalids will derive much benefit from
indulging in the <i>Siesta</i> whenever they feel
languid.</p>

<p>A Sailor will tell you, that a Seaman can
sleep as much in five hours, as a Landsman
can in ten.</p>

<p>Whether rising very early lengthens Life
we know not,&mdash;but think that sitting up
very late shortens it,&mdash;and recommend you
to rise by eight, and retire to rest by eleven;
your feelings will bear out the adage,
that &ldquo;<i>one</i> Hour&rsquo;s rest before midnight, is
worth <i>two</i> after.&rdquo;</p>

<p>When <span class="smcap">Old People</span> have been examined
with a view to ascertain the causes of their<span class="pagenum" title="75"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75"></a></span>
Longevity, they have uniformly agreed in

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Franklin</span> published an ingenious
Essay on the advantage of early rising&mdash;He
called it &ldquo;<i>an Economical Project</i>,&rdquo; and
calculated, that the saving that might be
made in the City of Paris, <i>by using Sunshine
instead of Candles</i>&mdash;at no less than
¬£4,000,000 Sterling.</p>

<p>If the Delicate, and the nervous, the very
Young, or the very Old&mdash;sit up beyond
their usual hour, they feel the want of
artificial aid, to raise their spirits to what
is no more than the ordinary pitch of those
who are in the vigour of their Life&mdash;and
must fly from the festive board&mdash;or purchase
a few hours of hilarity at the heavy
price of Head-Ach and Dyspepsia for many
days after; and a terrible exasperation of<span class="pagenum" title="76"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76"></a></span>
any Chronic Complaint they are afflicted
with.</p>

<p>When the Body and Mind are both
craving repose&mdash;to force their action, by
the spur of spirituous stimulus, is the most
extravagant waste of the &ldquo;<span class="smcap">Vis Vit√¶</span>,&rdquo; that
Fashion ever invented to consume her foolish
Votaries&mdash;for Fools they certainly are, who
mortgage the comfort of a Week, for the
conviviality of an Hour&mdash;with the certainty
of their term of Life being speedily foreclosed
by Gout, Palsy, &amp;c.</p>

<p>Among the most distressing miseries of

folks who turn night into day, or such as
delight in the sublime Economy of Cindersaving,
or Cobweb catching,&mdash;it is in vain to
seek repose, before the former has indulged
in the Evening&rsquo;s recreation of raking out
the Fire, and has played with the Poker
till it has made all the red coals black; or,
after <i>Molidusta</i>, the Tidy One, has awoke
the Morn&mdash;with &ldquo;the Broom, the bonny,
bonny Broom.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A determined Dusthunter, or Cindersaver,
murders its neighbour&rsquo;s sleep&mdash;with as little

struck up <i>&ldquo;Gently strike the warbling Lyre,&rdquo;</i>
and Will. Harmony&rsquo;s favourite Hornpipes of

the <i>dolce</i> and <i>pianissimo</i> of poor <span class="smcap">Ponder</span><span class="pagenum" title="79"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79"></a></span>
produced no diminution of the <i>prestissimo</i>

made not the least impression on him who
was beneath him.&mdash;He at length procured a
set of Skettles, and as soon as his musical
neighbour had done fiddling, he began <i>con
strepito</i>, and bowled away merrily till the
morning dawned.&mdash;The enraged Musician
did not wait long after daylight, to put in
his plea against such proceedings, and received
in reply, that such exercise had been
ordered by a Physician, as the properest
Paregoric, after being disturbed by the thorough
Bass of the Big Fiddle below&mdash;this
soon convinced the tormentor of Catgut,
who dwelt on the Ground-Floor, that He
could not annoy his superior with Impunity,
and produced silence on both sides.</p>

<p>Those who have not the power to please&mdash;should

<p><i>Little Sweep Soot Ho</i> is another dreadful
disturber.&mdash;The shrill screaming of these
poor boys, &ldquo;making night hideous,&rdquo; (indeed
at any time) at five or six o&rsquo;clock in cold
dark weather, is a most barbarous custom,
and frequently disturbs a whole street before
they rouse the drowsy sluggard who sent for

<p>However soundly he has slept during the
early part of the night&mdash;if the finishing Nap
in the morning is interrupted from continuing
to its natural termination&mdash;his whole System
is shook by it, and all that sleep has before
done for him, is undone in an instant;&mdash;he
gets up distracted and languid, and the only
part of his head that is of any use to him,
is the hole between his Nose and Chin.</p>

<p>The firm Health of those who live in the
Country, arises not merely from breathing a
purer Air,&mdash;but from quiet and regular
habits, especially the enjoyment of plenty of
undisturbed Repose,&mdash;this enables them to
take Exercise, which gives them an Appetite,
and by taking their food at less distant and
more equally divided intervals&mdash;they receive
a more regular supply of that salutary nourishment,
which is necessary to restore the
wear of the system, and support it in an
uniform state of excitement,&mdash;equally exempt<span class="pagenum" title="83"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83"></a></span>
from the languor of inanition, and the fever
of repletion.</p>

<p>Thus, the Animal Functions are performed
with a perfection and regularity, the tranquillity
of which, in the incessantly irregular
habits of a Town-life, is continually interrupted,&mdash;some
ridiculous Anxiety or other
consumes the Animal Spirits, and the important
process of Restoration is imperfectly
performed.</p>

<p><i>Dyspeptic and Nervous disorders</i>, and an
inferior degree of both extensive and intensive
Life<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">31</a> are the inevitable consequence,
and are the lowest price for (what are called)
<i>the Pleasures of Fashionable Society</i>.</p>

<p>Dr. Cadogan has told us (very truly) that
Chronic diseases, (and we may add, most of
those equivocal Disorders, which are con<span class="pagenum" title="84"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84"></a></span>tinually
teasing people, but are too insignificant
to induce them to institute a medical
process to remove them,) are caused by Indolence&mdash;Intemperance&mdash;and
Vexation.</p>

<p>It is the fashion to refer all these Disorders
to Debility&mdash;but Debility is no more than
the effect of Indolence, Intemperance, and
Vexation&mdash;the two first are under our own
immediate control&mdash;and Temperance, Industry,
and Activity, are the best remedies
to prevent, or remove the Debility which
reduces our means of resisting the third.</p>

<p>During <i>the Summer</i> of Life<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">32</a>, <i>i. e.</i> the second
period of it, (see <a href='#Page_34'>page 34</a>,) while we hope that
every thing may come right, the Heart
bounds with vigour, and the Vital flame burns<span class="pagenum" title="85"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85"></a></span>
too brightly to be much, or long subdued by
vexation.</p>

<p>This originally least cause, soon becomes
the greatest, and in <i>the Autumn</i> of
our existence, when Experience has dissipated
the theatric illusion with which Hope
varnished the expectations of our earlier days,
we begin to fear that every thing will go
wrong.</p>

<p>The insatiable ruling passions of the second
and third periods of Life,&mdash;Ambition and
Avarice,&mdash;the loss of our first and best
friends, our Parents,&mdash;regret for the past,
and anxiety about the future, prevent the
enjoyment of the present,&mdash;and are <i>the
cause of those Nervous and Bilious Disorders</i>,
which attack most of us at the commencement
of the third period of Life&mdash;these
<i>precursors of Palsy and Gout</i>, may generally<span class="pagenum" title="86"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86"></a></span>
be traced to Disappointments and Anxiety of
mind<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">33</a>; and</p>

<p>People need not groan about the Insanities
and Absurdities of others&mdash;it is surely quite<span class="pagenum" title="87"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87"></a></span>
sufficient to suffer for our own, of which most
of us have plenty&mdash;we ought to endeavour
to convert those of others, into causes of
comfort and consolation, instead of fretting
about them&mdash;if you receive rudeness in return
for civility&mdash;and ingratitude for kindness,
it may move your Pity&mdash;but should
never excite your Anger&mdash;instead of murmuring
at Heaven for having created such
Crazy Creatures! be fervently thankful that
you are not equally inconsistent and ridiculous&mdash;and
Pray, that your own Mind,
may not be afflicted with the like aberrations.</p>

<p><i>Indigestion</i><a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">34</a>, is the chief cause of perturbed
Sleep, and often excites the imaginary presence
of that troublesome Bedfellow <i>the
Nightmare</i>. On this subject see <i><a href="#PEPTIC_PRECEPTS">Peptic Precepts</a></i></p>

<p>Some cannot Sleep if they eat any Supper&mdash;and
certainly the lighter this meal is,
the better&mdash;Others, need not put on their<span class="pagenum" title="88"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88"></a></span>
Night cap, if they do not first bribe their
Stomachs to good behaviour by a certain
quantity of Bread and Cheese and Beer, &amp;c.
&amp;c., and go to Bed almost immediately after.</p>

<p>As to the wholesomeness of <i>a Solid Supper,
per se</i>, we do not think it advisable,&mdash;but
habit may have made it indispensable, and
we know it is often the most comfortable
Meal among the middle ranks of Society,
who have as large a share of Health as any.</p>

<p>We caution <i>Bad sleepers</i> to beware how
they indulge in the habit of exciting sleep,
by taking any of the preparations of <i>Opium</i>&mdash;they
are all injurious to the Stomach&mdash;and
often inconvenient in their effects upon
the Bowels:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Repose</span> <i>by small fatigue is earned</i>, and
Weariness can snore upon the flint, when
nesty Sloth, finds a down pillow hard.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As there can be no good <i>Digestion</i> without
diligent <i>Mastication</i>,&mdash;so there can be no
sound <i>Sleep</i>, without sufficient <i>Exercise</i>.</p>

<p><i>The most inoffensive and agreeable Anodyne</i>
is to drink some good White Wine, or Mulled<span class="pagenum" title="89"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89"></a></span>
Wine, by way of a supplement to your Night
cap.&mdash;One glass, taken when in Bed, immediately
before lying down, is as effective as
two or three if you sit up any time after.&mdash;(See
<i>Tewahdiddle</i>, No. 467.)</p>

<p>Many people, if awoke during their first
sleep, are unsettled all that night&mdash;and uncomfortable
and nervous the following day.&mdash;The
first sleep of those who eat Suppers,
commonly terminates when the food passes
from the Stomach.&mdash;Invalids then awake,
and sometimes remain so, in a Feverish
state,&mdash;the Stomach feeling discontented
from being unoccupied, and having nothing
to play with:&mdash;a small crust of Bread, or
a bit of Biscuit well chewed, accompanied
or not, as Experience and Instinct will
suggest, with a few mouthsful of Mutton or
Beef Broth (No. 564), or Toast and Water
(No. 463*), or single Grog<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">35</a>, (<i>i. e.</i> one
Brandy to nine Waters), will often restore<span class="pagenum" title="90"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90"></a></span>
its tranquillity, and catch Sleep again, which
nothing invites so irresistibly, as introducing
something to the Stomach,&mdash;that will entertain
it, without fatiguing it.</p>

<p>We have heard persons say they have been
much distressed by an intemperate craving
for Food when they awoke out of their first
sleep, and have not got to sleep soundly
again after&mdash;and risen in the morning as
tired as when they went to bed at night&mdash;but
without any appetite for Breakfast&mdash;such
will derive great benefit from the foregoing
Advice.</p>

<p><i>A Broth</i> (No. 564), <i>or Gruel</i> (No. 572)
<i>Supper</i>, is perhaps the best for the Dyspeptic,&mdash;and
those who have eaten and drank plentifully
at Dinner.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Bed Room</span> should be in the quietest
situation possible, as it were &ldquo;<i>the Temple of
Silence</i>,&rdquo;&mdash;and, if possible, not less than 16
feet square&mdash;the height of this Apartment, <i>in
which we pass almost half of our Time</i>, is in
modern houses absurdly abridged, to increase
that of the Drawing Room, which is often<span class="pagenum" title="91"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91"></a></span>
not occupied once in a month:&mdash;instead of
living in the pleasant part of the House,
where they might enjoy Light and Air, how
often we find people squeezing themselves
into &ldquo;a nice snug Parlour,&rdquo; where Apollo
cannot spy.</p>

<p>We do not recommend either <i>Curtains</i> or
<i>Tester</i>, &amp;c. to the <span class="smcap">Bed</span>, especially during the
Summer;&mdash;by the help of these, those who
might have the benefit of the free circulation
of air in a large Room, very ingeniously
contrive to reduce it to a small Closet:&mdash;<i>Chimney-Boards</i>
and <i>Window-Curtains</i> are
also inadmissible in a Bed Room; but Valetudinarians
who are easily awoke, or very
susceptible of Cold, will do wisely to avail
themselves of well made <i>Double<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">36</a> Windows
and Doors</i>, these exclude both Noise and
Cold in a very considerable degree.</p>

<p><i>The best Bed</i> is a well stuffed and well
curled <i>Horsehair Mattress</i>, six inches thick at<span class="pagenum" title="92"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92"></a></span>
the Head, gradually diminishing to three at
Feet, on this another Mattress five or six
inches in thickness: these should be unpicked
and exposed to the air, once every Year. An
elastic Horsehair mattress, is incomparably
the most pleasant, as well as the most wholesome
Bed.</p>

<p><i>Bed Rooms</i> should be thoroughly ventilated
by leaving both the Window and the Door
open every day when the weather is not cold
or damp&mdash;during which the Bed should
remain unmade, and the Clothes be taken
off and spread out for an hour, at least, before
the Bed is made again.</p>

<p><i>In very Hot Weather</i>, the temperature becomes
considerably cooler every minute
after ten o&rsquo;clock&mdash;between eight o&rsquo;clock
and twelve, the Thermometer often falls in
Sultry weather&mdash;from ten to twenty degrees&mdash;and
those who can sit up till twelve o&rsquo;clock,
will have the advantage of sleeping in an
Atmosphere many degrees cooler, than those
who go to bed at ten:&mdash;this is extremely
important to Nervous Invalids&mdash;who how<span class="pagenum" title="93"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93"></a></span>ever
extremely they may suffer from heat,
we cannot advise to sleep with the smallest
part of the window open during the night&mdash;in
such sultry days, the <i>Siesta</i> (see <a href='#Page_94'>page 94</a>,)
will not only be a great support against the
heat, but will help You to sit up to enjoy the
advantage above stated.</p>

<p><i>A Fire in the Bed Room</i>, is sometimes
indispensable&mdash;but not as usually made&mdash;it
is commonly lighted only just before bed-time,
and prevents Sleep by the noise it
makes, and the unaccustomed stimulus of
its light.</p>

<p>Chimneys frequently smoke when a fire is
first lighted, particularly in snowy and frosty
weather; and an Invalid has to encounter
not only the damp and cold of the Room&mdash;but
has his Lungs irritated with the sulphureous
puffs from the fresh lighted Fire.</p>

<p>A Fire should be lighted about three or
four hours before, and so managed that it
may burn entirely out half an hour before
you go to Bed&mdash;then the air of the room
will be comfortably warmed&mdash;and certainly<span class="pagenum" title="94"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94"></a></span>
more fit to receive an Invalid who has been
sitting all day in a parlour as hot as an Oven,&mdash;than
a damp chamber, that is as cold as
a Well.</p>

<h2><a id="THE_SIESTA"></a>THE SIESTA.</h2>

<hr class="fixed5" />

<p>The Power of <i>Position</i> and <i>Temperature</i> to
alleviate the Paroxysms of many Chronic
Disorders, has not received the consideration
it deserves&mdash;a little attention to the variations
of the Pulse, will soon point out the
effect they produce on the Circulation, &amp;c.&mdash;<i>extremes
of Heat and Cold</i>, with respect to
Food, Drink, and Air, are equally to be
guarded against.</p>

<p><i>Old and Cold Stomachs</i>&mdash;The Gouty&mdash;and
those whose Digestive Faculties are
Feeble&mdash;should never have any thing <i>Cold</i><a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">37</a>,
<span class="pagenum" title="95"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95"></a></span>or <i>Old</i>, put into them&mdash;especially in Cold
Weather.</p>

<p><i>Food must take the temperature of our
Stomach</i>, (which is probably not less than
120,) <i>before Digestion can commence</i>.</p>

<p>When the Stomach is feeble, <i>Cold Food</i>
frequently produces Flatulence&mdash;Palpitation
of the Heart, &amp;c.&mdash;and all the other
troublesome accompaniments of Indigestion.&mdash;The
immediate remedy for these is Hot
Brandy and Water, and the horizontal
Posture.</p>

<p><i>Dyspeptic Invalids</i> will find 75 a good
temperature for their drink at Dinner, and
120 for Tea, &amp;c.</p>

<p>Persons who are in a state of Debility
from Age,&mdash;or other causes,&mdash;will derive
much benefit from laying down, and seeking
Repose whenever they feel fatigued, especially
during (the first half-hour at least of)
the business of Digestion&mdash;and will receive
almost as much refreshment from half an
hour&rsquo;s Sleep&mdash;as from Half a Pint of Wine.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="96"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96"></a></span>
<i>The Restorative influence of the recumbent
Posture</i>, cannot be conceived&mdash;the increased
energy it gives to the circulation,
and to the organs of Digestion, can only be
understood by those Invalids who have experienced
the comforts of it.</p>

<p><i>The Siesta</i> is not only advisable, but indispensable
to those whose occupations oblige
them to keep late hours.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Actors</span> especially, whose profession is, of
all others, the most fatiguing&mdash;and requires
both the Mind and the Body to be in the
most intense exertion between 10 and 12
o&rsquo;clock at Night,&mdash;should avail themselves
of the <i>Siesta</i>&mdash;which is the true source of
Energy&mdash;half an hour&rsquo;s repose in the horizontal
posture, is a most beneficial Restorative.</p>

<p><i>Good Beef Tea</i><a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">38</a>, (No. 563), with a little
<span class="pagenum" title="97"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97"></a></span>bit of slightly toasted Bread taken about
nine o&rsquo;clock&mdash;is a comforting restorative,
which will support You through exertions
that, without such assistance, are exhausting&mdash;and
you go to bed fatigued&mdash;get up
fevered, &amp;c.</p>

<p>When Performers feel <i>Nervous, &amp;c.</i>&mdash;and
fear the circulation is below <i>Par</i>,&mdash;and too
languid to afford the due excitement, half an
hour before they sing, &amp;c.&mdash;they will do
wisely, to wind up their System, with a
little &ldquo;<i>Balsamum Vit√¶</i>.&rdquo;&mdash;See &ldquo;<span class="smcap"><a href="#PEPTIC_PRECEPTS">Peptic

<p><span class="smcap">Actors</span> and <span class="smcap">Singers</span> are continually
assailed by a variety of circumstances extremely
unfavourable to Health&mdash;especially
from sitting up late at night&mdash;to counteract
which, we recommend <i>the Siesta</i>, and plenty
of Exercise in a pure Air.</p>

<p>When they feel <i>Nervous</i>&mdash;<i>Bilious, &amp;c. i. e.</i>
that their whole System is so deranged by
fatigue and anxiety, that they cannot proceed
effectively and comfortably,&mdash;they must
give their Throats two or three days&rsquo; rest<span class="pagenum" title="99"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99"></a></span>&mdash;cleanse
the Alimentary Canal with Peristaltic
Persuaders&mdash;see <a href="#Peristaltic_Persuaders">Index</a>&mdash;and corroborate
the Organs of Digestion with the Tonic
Tincture (No. 569), see <a href="#Tincture">Index</a>.</p>

<p>Strong <span class="smcap">Peppermint Lozenges</span>, made
by <span class="smcap">Smith</span>, Fell Street, Wood Street, Cheapside,
are very convenient portable Carminatives:&mdash;as
soon as they are dissolved, their
influence is felt from the beginning to the
end of the Alimentary Canal&mdash;they dissipate
Flatulence so immediately, that they well
deserve the name of <i>Vegetable Ether</i>; and
are recommended to <span class="smcap">Singers</span> and <span class="smcap">Public
Speakers</span>&mdash;as giving effective excitement
to the Organs of Voice&mdash;as a support against
the distressing effects of Fasting too long&mdash;and
to give energy to the Stomach between
Meals.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Power of the Voice</span> depends
upon the vigorous state of the circulation
supplying the Organs of Voice, with
energy to execute the intentions of the
Singer or Speaker&mdash;without which&mdash;the<span class="pagenum" title="100"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100"></a></span>
most accurate Ear and experienced Throat,
will sometimes fail in producing the exact
quality and quantity of Tone they intend.</p>

<p>That the <span class="smcap">Voice</span> is sometimes <i>too Flat</i>, or
<i>too Sharp, &amp;c.</i> is not a matter of astonishment&mdash;to
those who really understand how
arduous a task Singers have sometimes to
perform;&mdash;it would only be wonderful if it
was not&mdash;how is the Throat exempted from
those collapses which occasionally render
imperfect the action of every other fibre and
function of our Body?</p>

<p>The <i>Dyspeptic</i>, who Tries the effect of
Recumbency after Eating,&mdash;will soon be
convinced that <i>Tristram Shandy</i> was right
enough, when he said, that &ldquo;both pain, and
pleasure, are best supported in an horizontal
posture.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If after Dinner the Poppies of repletion
shed their influence on thy Eyelids&mdash;indulge
thou kind Nature&rsquo;s hint.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;A
quiet slumber in a comfortable warm room,
favoureth the operation of Digestion&mdash;and<span class="pagenum" title="101"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101"></a></span>
thou shalt rise, refreshed, and ready for the
amusements of the Evening.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The <i>Semi-Siesta</i> is a pleasant position&mdash;(<i>i. e.</i>
putting up the feet on a stool about
eight inches high;) but catching a nap in
a Chair is advisable only as a substitute
when the Horizontal posture is not convenient&mdash;when
you can, lie down on a Sofa&mdash;loosen
all ligatures&mdash;and give your Bowels
fair play.</p>

<p>These opinions,&mdash;which are the results of
Personal experience&mdash;are exactly in unison
with those of the following Medical Professors.</p>

<p>&ldquo;From Eating comes Sleep&mdash;from Sleep
Digestion.&rdquo;&mdash;<span class="smcap">Sanctorius</span>, Sec. iv. Aph. 59.</p>

<h2><a id="CLOTHES"></a>CLOTHES.</h2>

<hr class="fixed5" />

<p>Of all the Customs of Clothing, the most
extremely absurd is the usual arrangement
of <i>Bed Clothes</i>, which in order as the
chambermaid fancies to make the Bed look<span class="pagenum" title="104"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104"></a></span>
pretty in the Day time&mdash;are left long at the
head, that they may cover the Pillows;
when they are turned down, You have an
intolerable load on your Lungs, and that
part of the Body which is most exposed
during the day&mdash;is smothered at night&mdash;with
double the quantity of Clothes that
any other part has.</p>

<p>Sleep is prevented by an unpleasant degree
of either Heat or Cold; and in this ever-varying
climate, where often &ldquo;in one monstrous
day all seasons mix,&rdquo; delicate Thermometrical
persons will derive much comfort
from keeping a Counterpane in reserve
for an additional covering <i>in very Cold
Weather:</i> when some extra clothing is as
needful by Night,&mdash;as a great coat is by
Day.</p>

<p>A Gentleman who has a mind to carry
the adjustment of his Clothes to a nicety&mdash;may
have the shelves of his Wardrobe numbered
30, 40, 50, 60, &amp;c. and according to
the degree of Cold pointed to by his Fahren<span class="pagenum" title="105"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105"></a></span>heit<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">40</a>,
he may wear a corresponding defence
against it:&mdash;This mode of adjusting Dress
according to the vicissitudes of the weather,
&amp;c. is as rational as the ordinary
practice of regulating it by the Almanack,
or the Fashion, which in this uncertain
Climate and capricious Age&mdash;will as often
lead us wrong, as right.</p>

<p>Leave off your Winter Clothes late in the
Spring;&mdash;put them on early in the Autumn.
By wearing your Winter Clothes during the
first half dozen warm days&mdash;You get some
fine perspirations&mdash;which are highly salutary
in removing obstructions in the cutaneous
pores, &amp;c.</p>

<p><i>Delicate and Dyspeptic persons are often
distressed by changing their Dress</i>,&mdash;which<span class="pagenum" title="106"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106"></a></span>
must be as uniform as possible,&mdash;in thickness&mdash;in
quality&mdash;and in form,&mdash;especially
(Flannel, or indeed) whatever is worn
next to the Skin.</p>

<p>The change of a thick Waistcoat for a thin
one&mdash;or a long one for a shorter one&mdash;not
putting on Winter garments soon enough,
or leaving them off too soon,&mdash;will often
excite a violent disorder in the Lungs&mdash;or
Bowels, &amp;c. and exasperate any constitutional
complaint.</p>

<p>Those who wear <i>Flannel Waistcoats</i>, are
recommended to have their new ones about
the middle of November, with sleeves to
them coming down to the wrist&mdash;the shortening
these sleeves in the warm weather,
is as effective an antidote against extreme
Heat&mdash;as lengthening them, and closing
the Cuff of the Coat, is against intense Cold.</p>

<p>Our <span class="smcap">Coat</span><a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">41</a> should be made so large&mdash;that
when buttoned we may be as easy as
when it is unbuttoned, so that without
any unpleasant increase of pressure on the
Chest, &amp;c. we can wear it closely buttoned
up to the Chin&mdash;the power of doing this is
a convenient provision against the sudden
alternations from heat to cold&mdash;buttoning
up this outer garment, will protect the
delicate from many mischiefs which so often
arise in this inconstant climate from the
want of such a defence; and the additional
warmth it produces will often cure slight
Colds, <span class="pagenum" title="107"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107"></a></span>&amp;c.</p>

<p>Another way of accumulating Caloric, is
to have two sets of button holes to the<span class="pagenum" title="108"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108"></a></span>
<span class="smcap">Cuff</span> of the Coat, (especially of your Great
Coat,) one of which will bring it quite close
round the wrist.</p>

<p>When the Circulation is languid, and your
<i>Feet are Cold</i>&mdash;wear worsted Stockings, have
your Shoes well warmed&mdash;and when you
take them from the Fire&mdash;put your Slippers<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">42</a>
to it&mdash;that they may be warm and comfortable
for you on your return home.</p>

<p><i>In Wet Weather</i> wear Shoes with double
upper-leathers&mdash;- two thin leathers will keep
you much drier than one thick one, and are
more pliable&mdash;the Currier&rsquo;s Dubbing is the
best nourisher of Leather&mdash;and renders it
as soft as satin, and impervious to Water.</p>

<p>The mean temperature of England is about
50 degrees of Fahrenheit&mdash;it sometimes
rises 25 degrees above this, in the height of
Summer,&mdash;falls about as much below, in<span class="pagenum" title="109"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109"></a></span>
the depth of Winter&mdash;and in Summer frequently
varies from 20 to 30 degrees between
Mid-day and Midnight.</p>

<p><i>The restoration, and the preservation of
the Health, especially of those who have
passed their</i> <span class="smcap">Fortieth</span> <i>Year</i>,&mdash;depends upon
minute and unremitting attentions to Food,&mdash;Clothes,&mdash;Exercise,
&amp;c. which taken singly
may appear trifling&mdash;but combined, are of
infinite importance.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>If you are careful of it, Glass will last
as long as Iron.</i>&rdquo; By a regular observance
of a few salutary precepts, a delicate Constitution
will last as long, and afford its
Proprietor as many Amusements, as a Strong
Body,&mdash;whose Mind takes but little care
of it.</p>

<p>Invalids are advised to put on a Great
Coat when they go out, and the temperature
of the external air is not higher than 40.
Some susceptible Constitutions require this
additional clothing when the Thermometer
falls below 50; especially at the commencement
of the Cold weather.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="110"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110"></a></span>
<span class="smcap">A Great Coat</span> must be kept in a Room
where there is a Fire,&mdash;if it has been hung
up in a cold damp Hall, as it often is, it will
contribute about as much to your Calorification,&mdash;as
if You wrapped a Wet Blanket
about You.</p>

<p><i>Clothes</i> should be warm enough to defend
us from Cold<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">43</a>,&mdash;and large<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">44</a> enough to let
every movement be made with as much<span class="pagenum" title="111"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111"></a></span>
ease when they are on,&mdash;as when they
are off.</p>

<p>Those whose employments are sedentary,&mdash;especially
hard Students&mdash;who often
neglect taking sufficient Exercise<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">45</a>, suffer
extremely from the pressure of tight <i>Waistbands</i>&mdash;<i>Garters,
&amp;c.</i> which are the cause
of many of the mischiefs that arise from
long sitting&mdash;during which they should be
loosened.</p>

<p><i>Braces</i> have been generally considered a<span class="pagenum" title="112"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112"></a></span>
great improvement in modern dress&mdash;because
they render the pressure of the Waistband
unnecessary, which when extremely close is
certainly prejudicial&mdash;but we have always
thought they have produced more inconvenience
than they have removed&mdash;for if the
inferior Viscera get thereby more freedom of
action&mdash;the superior suffer for it&mdash;and,
moreover, <i>Ruptures</i> are much more frequent&mdash;the
Girdle which formerly prevented them
being removed,&mdash;and, instead of that useful
and partial horizontal pressure, in spite of
the elastic springs which have been attached
to the Braces, the whole body is grievously
oppressed by the Vertical Bands.</p>

<p>The best material for Breeches, is the
elastic worsted stocking stuff.</p>

<p><i>Tight Stays</i>&mdash;and <i>Braces</i>&mdash;obstruct the
circulation of the Blood, &amp;c. are the cause of
many Chronic Complaints, and often create
Organic Diseases<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">46</a>.</p>

<h2><a id="FIRE"></a>FIRE.</h2>

<hr class="fixed5" />

<p>As we advance in Age&mdash;the force of the
circulation being lessened, the warmth of
our Clothes and our coverings at night
should be gradually increased. &ldquo;After the
age of 35, it may be better to exceed, rather
than be deficient in clothing.&rdquo;&mdash;<span class="smcap">Adair&rsquo;s</span>
<i>Cautions</i>, p. 390.</p>

<p>Cold often kills the infirm and the aged,
and is the proximate cause of most Palsies;&mdash;it
is extremely desirable that Bed and
Sitting Rooms for Winter occupation, should
have a Southern aspect&mdash;when the Thermometer
is below 30, the proper place for<span class="pagenum" title="114"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114"></a></span>
people beyond 60, is their own Fire-side:&mdash;many
of the disorders and Deaths of persons
at this period of Life&mdash;originate from irregularity
in Diet, Temperature, &amp;c. by Dining
out, and frisking about, joining in Christmas
Gambols, &amp;c. in Cold weather.</p>

<p><i>The Art of making a room comfortably
warm</i>, does not consist merely in making
a very large Fire in it&mdash;but depends as
much on the keeping of cold air out&mdash;this
is best done by <i>Double Windows</i>, see <a href="#Page_91">page
91</a>, and double Doors,&mdash;at least take care
that your Sashes fit close,&mdash;that the beads
of the window frames are tight&mdash;stop the
aperture between the skirting boards and
the floor with putty&mdash;and list the Doors.</p>

<p>We suppose it almost needless to say that
every room in the house should be thoroughly
ventilated<a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">47</a> by a current of fresh Air&mdash;at
<span class="pagenum" title="115"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115"></a></span>
least once every day, when the weather is
not very damp&mdash;or cold. By making a Fire
accordingly&mdash;this may be done almost every
Day in the Year.</p>

<p>If You leave the Door open for <i>Five</i>
minutes&mdash;it will let in more cold air than
your Fire can make warm in <i>Fifteen</i>&mdash;therefore,
initiate your Domestics in these first
principles of the <i>Economy of Caloric</i>,&mdash;and
when the Weather is cold, caution them
to keep Doors shut.</p>

<p>A regular Temperature may be preserved
by a simple contrivance attached to a Thermometer,
which will open an aperture to
admit the external air&mdash;when the apartment
is heated above the degree desired (<i>i. e.</i>
about 60 for common constitutions,) and
exclude it when it falls below it.</p>

<p>A Room, which is in constant occupation
all day&mdash;may be occasionally <i>pumped</i>
by moving the door backward and forward
for several minutes.</p>

<p>We do not advise Invalids to indulge<span class="pagenum" title="116"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116"></a></span>
themselves in heating their rooms to a higher
temperature<a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">48</a> than from 60 to 65.&mdash;Those
who have resided the best part of their Life
in warm climates&mdash;will like the latter best.
While we recommend the Aged and Infirm
to be kept comfortably warm&mdash;they must
at the same time cautiously avoid excess of
heat.</p>

<p>When the Thermometer tells them that
the external air is under 60,&mdash;whether it be
in July, or in January,&mdash;those who are susceptible
of Cold, must tell their Servants to
keep a small fire&mdash;especially if the Weather
be at the same time damp.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="117"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117"></a></span>
Those who, from caprice, or parsimony,&mdash;instead
of obeying this comfortable and salutary
precept, sit shivering and murmuring,
and refuse to employ the Coal-merchant, as
a substitute for the Sun&mdash;may soon spend
in Physic, more than they have saved in
Fuel.</p>

<p>By raising the temperature of my Room
to about 65, taking a full dose of Epsom
Salts, and a Broth Diet, and retiring to rest
an hour sooner than usual, I have often very
speedily got rid of <i>Colds</i>, &amp;c.</p>

<p>The following <i>Plan of Lighting and managing
a Fire</i>, has been attended with great
comfort and convenience to myself, (particularly
at the beginning and the end of
winter, when a very small fire is sufficient),
and I think considerable saving of coals.</p>

<p>Fill your Grate with fresh coals quite up
to the upper bar but one, then lay in your
faggot of wood in the usual manner, rather
collected in a mass, than scattered, that a
body of concentrated heat may be produced<span class="pagenum" title="118"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118"></a></span>
as soon as possible; over the faggot place
the cinders of the preceding day&mdash;piled up
as high as the grate will admit, and placed
loosely in rather large fragments&mdash;in order
that the draft may be free&mdash;a bit or two of
fresh coal may be added to the cinders when
once they are lighted, but no small coal must
be thrown on at first, for the reason above
stated:&mdash;when all is prepared, light the wood,
when the cinders becoming in a short time
thoroughly ignited&mdash;the gas rising from the
coals below, which will now be effected by
the heat, will take fire as it passes through
them, leaving a very small portion of smoke
to go up the Chimney.</p>

<p>The advantage of this mode of lighting a
fire is, that small coal is better suited to the
purpose than large&mdash;except a few pieces in
front to keep the small from falling out of
the Grate&mdash;it may be kept in reserve, to be
put on afterwards if wanted. I have frequently
known my fire lighted at 8 o&rsquo;clock
in the morning, continue burning till 11 at<span class="pagenum" title="119"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119"></a></span>
night, without any thing being done to it:
when apparently quite out, on being stirred,
you have in a few minutes a glowing fire: it
will sometimes be necessary to loosen, or stir
slightly the upper part of the fire if it begins
to cake&mdash;but the lower part must not be
touched, otherwise it will burn away too soon.</p>

<h2><a id="AIR"></a>AIR.</h2>

<hr class="fixed5" />

<p>Many Invalids are hurried into their Grave&mdash;by
the indiscreet kindness of their friends
forcing them from the comforts of Home&mdash;for
the sake of Air more abounding with
<i>Oxygen, i. e.</i> the vivifying part of the atmosphere:&mdash;that
great benefit is received from
what is <i>called</i> change of air is true enough&mdash;it
is seldom considered that there is also a
change in most of the other circumstances
of the patient&mdash;many, of infinitely more im<span class="pagenum" title="120"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120"></a></span>portance,
than that which derives all the
credit of the Cure.</p>

<p>For instance, if a person living in a confined
part of the City&mdash;neglecting exercise,
harassed all day by the anxieties of Business,
and sitting up late at Night, &amp;c. be removed
to the tranquillity of rural scenes, which
invite him to be almost constantly taking
Exercise in the open Air, and retiring to rest
at an early hour&mdash;and thus, instead of being
surrounded by irritations unfavourable to
Health, enjoying all the &ldquo;<i>jucunda oblivia
vit√¶</i>&rdquo; which are favourable to it&mdash;such a
Change will often do wonders, and sufficiently
account for the miraculous cures attributed to&mdash;<i>Change
of Air</i>.</p>

<p>Chemical Philosophers assert indeed&mdash;that
a Gallon of the unsavoury Gas from Garlick
Hill, gives as high a proportion of <i>Oxygen</i>,
as the like quantity of the ethereal element
of Primrose Hill:&mdash;this seems incredible, and
must arise either from the imperfection of
the <i>Eudiometer</i> giving erroneous results, or<span class="pagenum" title="121"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121"></a></span>
from the air being impregnated with matter
unfriendly to Health, which the instruments
employed to analyze it, have not the power
of denoting:&mdash;let any one thread the mazes
of a crowded city, and walk for the same
space of time in a pleasant Country&mdash;the
animal spirits will soon testify, which is the
most exhilarating.</p>

<p>However, people certainly do live long,
and enjoy Health, in situations apparently
very unfavourable to Animal Life.</p>

<p>Our Omniscient Creator has given to our
Lungs, the same faculty of extracting nutriment
from various kinds of Air&mdash;as the
Stomach has from various kinds of Aliment:&mdash;the
Poor man who feeds on the coarsest
food, is supported by it in as sound Health,
as the Rich man who fares sumptuously every
day.</p>

<p>Well then, in nine cases out of ten,
to change the Atmosphere we have been
long accustomed to, is as unadvisable as a
change in the Food we have been used to<span class="pagenum" title="122"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122"></a></span>&mdash;unless
other circumstances make it so, than
the mere change of Place.</p>

<p>The Opulent Invalid who has been long
indulged with a Home arranged to his humour&mdash;must
beware (especially during any exacerbation
of his infirmity) of leaving it&mdash;it
would be almost as desperate a procedure as
to eject an Oyster from his Shells.</p>

<p>The more luxuriously you live, the more
Exercise<a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">49</a> you require,&mdash;the &ldquo;<i>Bon Vivant</i>&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum" title="123"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123"></a></span>
may depend upon the truth of the advice
which Sir Charles Scarborough gave to the
Duchess of Portsmouth, &ldquo;You must Eat less,&mdash;or
take more Exercise<a name="FNanchor_50_50" id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">50</a>&mdash;or take Physic,&mdash;or
be Sick.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="124"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124"></a></span>
Exercise is the grand power to promote
the Circulation through the capillary vessels,
by which the constitution is preserved from
obstructions,&mdash;Appetite increased, and Digestion
improved in all its stages,&mdash;the due
distribution of nourishment, invigorates the
Nervous System, gives firmness and elasticity
to the Muscles, and strength to every part of
the System.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="125"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125"></a></span>
Exercise, to have its full effect, must be
continued till we feel a sensible degree of
<i>Perspiration</i>,&mdash;(which is the <i>Panacea for the
prevention of Corpulence</i>)&mdash;see <a href='#Page_50'>page 50</a>&mdash;and
should, at least once a-day, proceed to the
borders of fatigue, but never pass them,&mdash;or we
shall be weakened instead of strengthened.</p>

<p>Health depends upon perpetual Secretion
and Absorption, and Exercise only can produce
this.</p>

<p>After Exercise, take care to get cool gradually&mdash;when
your Head perspires, rub it,
and your Face, &amp;c. dry with a cloth:&mdash;this
is better for the Hair than the best &ldquo;Bear&rsquo;s
Grease,&rdquo; and will beautify the Complexion
beyond &ldquo;<i>La Cosm√©tique Royale</i>,&rdquo; or all the
Red and White Olympian Dew that was
ever imported.</p>

<p>One of the most important precepts for
the preservation of Health, is to take care of
<i>the Skin</i><a name="FNanchor_51_51" id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">51</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="126"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126"></a></span>
In Winter, the surface of the Body, the
Feet, &amp;c. should be washed twice or thrice
a Week, with water of the temperature of
about 98, and wiped every Day with a wet
towel;&mdash;<i>a Tepid Bath</i> of the like temperature
once a fortnight will also conduce much to
both health and comfort. Some advise that
the surface of the Body be wiped every
morning with a wet sponge, and rubbed dry
after, with not too fine a cloth.</p>

<p>Wine, especially Port, is generally twice

even until the acetous fermentation

now to call &ldquo;<i>Flavour</i>,&rdquo;&mdash;and Wine is not

so long.)</p>

<p>Our Wine-merchants keep it in Wood
from two to six years longer, according to
its original strength, &amp;c.&mdash;surely this must
be long enough to do all that can be done
by keeping it&mdash;what crude Wine it must be
to require even this time to ameliorate it&mdash;the
necessity for which, must arise either
from some error in the original manufacture,&mdash;or
a false taste, which does not relish it,
till Time has changed its original characteristics.</p>

<p><i>Ordinary Port</i> is a very uncleansed, fretful
Wine&mdash;and experienced judges have
assured us, that <i>the Best Port</i> is rather
impoverished than improved, by being kept
in Bottle longer than Two<a name="FNanchor_54_54" id="FNanchor_54_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">54</a> Years, <i>i. e.</i> supposing
<span class="pagenum" title="133"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133"></a></span>
it to have been previously from two
to four years in the Cask in this Country,&mdash;observing,
that all that the outrageous advocates
for &ldquo;<i>vin pass√©</i>&rdquo;&mdash;really know about
it, is, that <span class="smcap">Sherry</span> <i>is Yellow</i>,&mdash;and <span class="smcap">Port</span> <i>is
Black</i>,&mdash;and that if they drink enough of
either of them,&mdash;it will make them Drunk.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">White Wines</span>, especially <i>Sherry</i> and
<i>Madeira</i>, being more perfectly fermented,
and thoroughly fined before they are bottled&mdash;if
kept in a cellar of uniform temperature,
are not so rapidly deteriorated by Age.</p>

<p><i>The Temperature of a Good Cellar</i> is nearly
the same throughout the year. <i>Double Doors</i>
help to preserve this. It must be dry, and
be kept as clean as possible.</p>

<p><i>The Art of preserving Wines</i>, is to keep
them from fretting, which is done by keeping<span class="pagenum" title="134"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134"></a></span>
them in the same degree of heat, and careful
Corking<a name="FNanchor_55_55" id="FNanchor_55_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor">55</a>. &ldquo;If persons wish to preserve the
fine flavour of their Wines, they ought <i>on no
account</i> to permit any Bacon, Cheese, Onions,
Potatoes, or Cider, in their wine-cellars. Or,
if there be any disagreeable stench in the
Cellar, the wine will indubitably imbibe it;
consequently, instead of being fragrant and
charming to the nose and palate, it will be
extremely disagreeable.&rdquo;&mdash;<span class="smcap">Carnell</span> <i>on Wine
Making</i>, 8vo. 1814, p. 124. See also <i>Manuel
du Sommelier, par A. Jullien</i>, Paris, 1817.</p>

<p>That <span class="smcap">Madeira</span> (if properly matured before)
improves in quality by being carried to the
<i>East Indies</i> and back, by which Voyage it
loses from 8 to 10 Gallons,&mdash;or to the <i>West</i>,<span class="pagenum" title="135"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135"></a></span>
by which about 5 are wasted<a name="FNanchor_56_56" id="FNanchor_56_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_56" class="fnanchor">56</a>,&mdash;however
these round-about man&#339;uvres may tickle the
fancy of those folks who cannot relish any
thing that is not far-fetched, dear-bought,
and hard to be had, and to whom rarity is
the &ldquo;<i>sine qua non</i>&rdquo; of recommendation&mdash;it
is one of those inconvenient prejudices, from
which common sense preserve us!</p>

<p>The Vulgar objection to <i>New Wine</i>&mdash;(by
which we mean Wine that has been maturing
in Wood two years in Portugal&mdash;two in
England&mdash;and in Bottle more than twelve
months), is, that its exhilarating qualities are
too abundant, and intoxicate in too small
a dose&mdash;those &ldquo;<i>Bons Vivants</i>,&rdquo; to whom<span class="pagenum" title="136"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136"></a></span>
&ldquo;the Bottle, the Sun of the table,&rdquo; and who
are not in the habit of crying to go home to
Bed while they can see it shining,&mdash;require
Wines weaker than those which are usually
imported from Spain and Portugal,&mdash;however
<span class="smcap">Port</span> and <span class="smcap">Sherry</span> may be easily reduced
to the standard desired by the long-sitter,&mdash;&ldquo;<i>paululum
aceti acetosi</i>,&rdquo; will give
the Acid Go√ªt,&mdash;&ldquo;<i>aqua pura</i>&rdquo; will subdue
their Spirit &ldquo;<i>ad libitum</i>,&rdquo;&mdash;and produce <i>an
imitation of the flavour acquired by Age, extempore</i>&mdash;and
You can thus very easily
make fine fruity nutritious new Wine,&mdash;as
Light,&mdash;and as Old<a name="FNanchor_57_57" id="FNanchor_57_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_57" class="fnanchor">57</a>,&mdash;and as Poor, as you
please&mdash;and fit it exactly to your customer&rsquo;s
palate, whether &ldquo;<i>Massa drinky for Drinky,&mdash;or
drinky for Drunky Massa.</i>&rdquo;</p>

<p><i>To ameliorate very new, or very old Wine</i>&mdash;mix
a bottle of the one with a bottle of<span class="pagenum" title="137"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137"></a></span>
the other&mdash;or to a bottle of very old Port
add a glass or two of good new Claret&mdash;to
very new, a glass of Sherry.</p>

<p>Of all our Senses,&mdash;<i>the Taste</i>, especially
for Liquids, is the most sophisticated Slave of
Habit&mdash;&ldquo;De gustibus, non est disputandum.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Astringent matter, and Alcohol&mdash;which
render <span class="smcap">Port Wine</span> the prop of an
Englishman&rsquo;s Heart&mdash;are intolerable to the
palate of an Italian, or Frenchman.&mdash;But a
Stomach which has been accustomed to be
wound up by the double stimulus of Astringents,
and Alcohol also,&mdash;will not be content
with the latter only,&mdash;especially if that
be in less quantity&mdash;as it is in the <i>Italian
and French Wines</i>; which, therefore, for the
generality of Englishmen, are insufficiently
excitant.</p>

<p>He who has been in the habit of drinking
<span class="smcap">Porter</span> at Dinner,&mdash;and <span class="smcap">Port</span> after&mdash;will
feel uncomfortable with <i>Home-brewed
Ale</i>, and <i>Claret</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="138"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138"></a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Accum</span>, the chemist, analyzed for the
Editor, some <span class="smcap">Port</span> and <span class="smcap">Sherry</span> of the
finest quality&mdash;the <span class="smcap">Port</span><a name="FNanchor_58_58" id="FNanchor_58_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor">58</a> yielded 20 per
cent&mdash;and the <span class="smcap">Sherry</span> 19-25 per cent, of
<span class="smcap">Alcohol</span> of 825 specific gravity&mdash;<i>i. e.</i>
the strongest Spirit of Wine that can be
drawn, full double the strength of <span class="smcap">Brandy</span>,
<span class="pagenum" title="139"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139"></a></span>
which seldom has 40 per Cent, and common
<span class="smcap">Gin</span><a name="FNanchor_59_59" id="FNanchor_59_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_59" class="fnanchor">59</a> not more than 30&mdash;or 25.</p>

<p>Some people have a notion that if they go
to the Docks, they can purchase a Pipe of
Wine for twenty pounds less, than they<span class="pagenum" title="140"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140"></a></span>
must pay to a regular Wine Merchant&mdash;and,
moreover, have it <i>neat as imported</i>&mdash;as
if all Wines of the same <i>Name</i>, were of
the same Quality.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Port</span> <i>varies at Oporto in quality and price
as much as</i> <span class="smcap">Porter</span> <i>does in London</i>&mdash;it is
needless to say how difficult it is to obtain
the best Beer at any price&mdash;it is quite as
difficult to obtain the best Port Wine at
Oporto, where the very superior wine is all
bought up at a proportionately high price
by the agents for the London Wine Merchants.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Brandies</span> and <span class="smcap">Wines</span> <i>vary in quality
quite as much as they do in Price</i>: not less
than twenty pounds per Pipe in the country
where they are made.</p>

<p>The only way to obtain genuine wholesome
liquor, is to apply to a respectable
Wine Merchant&mdash;and beg of him to send
you the best wine at the regular market price.</p>

<p>If you are particular about the Quality
of what you buy&mdash;the less You ask about<span class="pagenum" title="141"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141"></a></span>
the price of it the better&mdash;if you are not,
bargain as hard as you please.</p>

<i>Those who drink Wine<a name="FNanchor_61_61" id="FNanchor_61_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_61" class="fnanchor">61</a>, &amp;c. for the purpose
it was given</i>, as a Cordial, to cheer the
Circulation, when it falters from Fatigue,
Age, or profuse Evacuations of any kind,
&ldquo;for the Stomach&rsquo;s sake,&rdquo; as St. Paul recommends
it, and for our &ldquo;often infirmities&rdquo;
as a medicine&mdash;will understand, that of all
the ways of saving, to run any risk of buying
inferior Wine, is the most ridiculously unwise
Economy.</p>

<p>To <i>Ice Wine</i> is another very unprofitable
and inconvenient custom&mdash;and not only deteriorates
its flavour, but by rendering it dull
in the mouth&mdash;people are induced to drink
too much, as they are deprived of the advantage
of knowing when they have got enough&mdash;for<span class="pagenum" title="144"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144"></a></span>
as soon as the Wine becomes warm in
their Stomachs,&mdash;the dose they have taken
merely to exhilarate them&mdash;makes them
drunk.</p>

<p><i>The true Economy of Drinking</i>,&mdash;is to
excite as much Exhilaration as may be,&mdash;with
as little Wine.</p>

<p>We deprecate the custom of <i>sitting for
Hours after Dinner, and keeping the Stomach
in an incessant state of irritation by sipping
Wine,&mdash;nothing can be more prejudicial to
Digestion</i><a name="FNanchor_62_62" id="FNanchor_62_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_62" class="fnanchor">62</a>&mdash;it is much better to mix Food
and Drink&mdash;and to take them by alternate
mouthsful.&mdash;See <a href='#Page_11'>page 11</a>.</p>

<p>Our &ldquo;<span class="smcap">Vinum Britannicum</span>&rdquo;&mdash;good
Home-brewed Beer&mdash;which has been very
deservedly called &ldquo;<i>Liquid Bread</i>,&rdquo; is pre<span class="pagenum" title="145"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145"></a></span>ferable
to any other Beverage during Dinner
or Supper&mdash;or <i>Port</i> or <i>Sherry</i> diluted with
about three or four times their quantity of
Toast and Water&mdash;(No. 463*): undiluted,
these Wines are too strong to be drank
during Dinner,&mdash;they act so powerfully on
the feelings of the Stomach, that they dull
the desire for solid Food, by producing the
sensation of Restoration,&mdash;and the System,
instead of receiving material to repair and
strengthen it,&mdash;is merely stimulated during
the action of the Vinous spirit.</p>

<p>However, the dull stimulus of Distention,
is insufficient for some delicate Stomachs,
which do absolutely require to be screwed
up with a certain quantity of diffusible
Stimulus<a name="FNanchor_63_63" id="FNanchor_63_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_63" class="fnanchor">63</a>,&mdash;without which, they cannot proceed
<span class="pagenum" title="146"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146"></a></span>
effectively to the business of Digestion,&mdash;or
indeed any other business&mdash;we do not
recommend such, especially if they have
passed the Meridian of Life, to attempt to
entirely wean themselves of it&mdash;but advise
them, <i>immediately after Dinner</i>, to drink as
much as is necessary to excite that degree
of action in their System, without which
they are uncomfortable, and then to stop.&mdash;See
Observations on <i><a href="#THE_SIESTA">Siesta</a></i>.</p>

<p>Now-a-days, <i>Babies</i> are brought to table
after Dinner by Children of larger growth&mdash;to
drink Wine,&mdash;which has as bad an effect
on their tender susceptible stomachs, as the
like quantity of <span class="smcap">Alcohol</span> would produce
upon an Adult.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="147"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147"></a></span>
Wine has been called &ldquo;the Milk of Old
Age,&rdquo; so &ldquo;Milk is the Wine of Youth.&rdquo;
As Dr. Johnson observed, it is much easier
to be abstinent than to be temperate&mdash;and
no man should habitually take Wine as
Food till he is past 30 years of age<a name="FNanchor_64_64" id="FNanchor_64_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_64" class="fnanchor">64</a> at
least;&mdash;happy is He who preserves this
best of Cordials in reserve, and only takes
it to support his Mind and Heart when distressed
by anxiety and fatigue. That which
may be a needful stimulus at 40 or 50,
will inflame the Passions into madness at
20 or 30&mdash;and at an earlier period is absolute
Poison.</p>

<p>Among other <i>innumerable Advantages
which the Water-drinker enjoys</i>, remember
he saves at least <span class="smcap">Fifty Guineas</span> per
annum&mdash;which the Beer and Wine drinker
wastes&mdash;as much to the detriment of his<span class="pagenum" title="148"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148"></a></span>
health, as the diminution of his Finances:
moreover, nothing deteriorates the sense of
Taste so soon as strong liquors&mdash;the <i>Water-drinker</i>
enjoys an exquisite sensibility of
Palate, and relish for plain food, that a
Wine-drinker has no idea of.</p>

<p>Some people make it a rule to drink a
certain number of Glasses of Wine during
and after dinner, whether they are dry, or
languid, or not&mdash;this is as ridiculous as it
would be to eat a certain number of Mutton
Chops whether you are hungry or not. The
effect produced by Wine is seldom the same,
even in the same person&mdash;and depends on
the state of the animal spirits at the time&mdash;whether
the stomach be full or empty, &amp;c.</p>

<p>The more simply Life is supported, and
the less Stimulus we use, the better&mdash;and
Happy are the Young and Healthy who are
wise enough to be convinced that Water is
the best drink, and Salt the best sauce.</p>

<p>But in Invalids past the Meridian of Life,
we believe as much mischief is going on<span class="pagenum" title="149"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149"></a></span>
when our Pulse hobbles along as if the Heart
was too tired to carry on the Circulation, as
can possibly be done to the constitution by
taking such a portion of Wine as will remove
the collapse&mdash;and excite the mainspring
of Life to vibrate with healthful
vigour.</p>

<p>The following is the Editor&rsquo;s plan of
taking liquid food at Dinner,&mdash;when he
cannot get Good Beer:&mdash;he has two wine
glasses of Sherry, or one of Whiskey<a name="FNanchor_65_65" id="FNanchor_65_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_65" class="fnanchor">65</a>, or
Brandy, (No. 471), and three-fourths of a
pint of good Toast and Water, (No. 463),
(which when Dyspeptic he has warmed to
about Summer Heat, <i>i. e.</i> 75 of Fahrenheit,)
and puts a wine-glass of Sherry, or half a
glass of Whiskey, &amp;c. into half a pint of the
water, and the other glass of Sherry, or half
glass of Whiskey, &amp;c. into the remaining
quarter pint&mdash;thus increasing the strength
<span class="pagenum" title="150"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150"></a></span>
of the liquid towards the conclusion of
Dinner, after which he drinks from two to
four glasses of Port or Sherry&mdash;as Instinct
suggests the state of the circulation requires&mdash;if
it be very languid, a <i>Liqueur</i> glass of <span class="smcap">Johnson&rsquo;s</span><a name="FNanchor_66_66" id="FNanchor_66_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_66" class="fnanchor">66</a>
<i>Witte Cura√ßoa</i><a name="FNanchor_67_67" id="FNanchor_67_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67_67" class="fnanchor">67</a> is occasionally recommended
<span class="pagenum" title="151"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151"></a></span>
as a renovating <i>Bonne Bouche</i>&mdash;about
a quarter of an hour after dinner, he
lies down on a Sofa, and sleeps for about
half an hour&mdash;this has been his custom for
the last twenty years&mdash;half an hour&rsquo;s horizontal
posture is more restorative to him&mdash;than
if he had sat up and drank three or
four more glasses of wine.</p>

<p>As to <i>the Wholesomeness of various Wines</i><a name="FNanchor_68_68" id="FNanchor_68_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68_68" class="fnanchor">68</a>,&mdash;that
<span class="pagenum" title="152"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152"></a></span>
depends on the integrity and skill of
the Wine-maker,&mdash;and upon the peculiar
state of the stomach of the Wine-drinker:&mdash;when
my Stomach is not in Good Temper,&mdash;it
generally desires to have <i>Red Wine</i>,&mdash;but
when in best Health,&mdash;nothing affronts
it more than to put <i>Port</i> into it&mdash;and one
<span class="pagenum" title="153"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153"></a></span>
of the first symptoms of its coming into
adjustment, is a wish for <i>White Wine</i>.</p>

<p>One of the chief causes of that derangement
of the Stomach, which delicate and
aged persons so constantly complain of after
<i>Dining out</i>&mdash;is the drinking of Wines, &amp;c.
which they are unused to.</p>

<p><i>White</i>, deserve to be preferred to <i>Red
Wines</i>,&mdash;because the latter being harder
pressed, and subjected to a stronger fermentation
to extract the colouring matter
from the husks of the Grape, are more
loaded with feculence.</p>

<p>Of <span class="smcap">Red Wines</span>, <i>Claret</i> is the best; and it
is to be lamented, that the Duty imposed
upon it is so great, that to moderate fortunes
it amounts to a prohibition&mdash;when we make
this observation, we do not mean to impeach
the prudence which has induced those who
no doubt best understand the subject,&mdash;to
determine that political necessity imperatively
decrees that the delightful and salubrious
wines of France&mdash;must be taxed<span class="pagenum" title="154"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154"></a></span>
twice as high as the coarse unwholesome
wines of Portugal.</p>

<p>Of the <i>White</i> Wines, we believe that
<i>Sherry</i> is the most easy&mdash;and <i>Madeira</i> the
most difficult to obtain genuine&mdash;most of
the <span class="smcap">Sweet</span> Wines are as artificially compounded,
as the Beers of this country; the
addition of Capillaire to Port wine, makes
what is commonly called <i>Tent</i>. <i>Mountain,
Calcavella, &amp;c.</i> are made up in the same
manner.</p>

<p>Not one Constitution in a thousand, is so
happily constructed or is constantly in such
perfect adjustment, that the operations of the
Abdominal Viscera (on which every other
movement of the system depends) proceed
with healthful regularity.</p>

<p>The following hints will point out to the
Reader, how to employ Art to afford that
assistance to Nature, which in Indisposition
and Age, is so often required, and will teach
him to counteract in the most prompt and
agreeable manner&mdash;the effects of those accidental
deviations from strict Temperance,&mdash;which
sometimes overcome the most abstemious
philosopher&mdash;when the seducing<span class="pagenum" title="157"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157"></a></span>
charms of Conviviality tempt him to forego
the prudent maxims of his cooler moments.</p>

<p>They will help those who have delicate
Constitutions, to obtain their fair share of
Health and Strength,&mdash;and instruct the
Weak, so to economize the powers they
have, that they may enjoy Life as well as the
Strong.</p>

<p>To humour that desire for the marvellous,
which is so universal in medical (as well as
in other) matters,&mdash;the makers of <i>Aperient
Pills</i> generally select the most <span class="smcap">Drastic
Purgatives</span>, which operating considerably
in a dose of a few grains, excite admiration
in the Patient, and faith in their powers, in
proportion as a small dose produces a great
effect,&mdash;who seldom considers how irritating
such materials must be,&mdash;and consequently
how injurious to a Stomach in a state of Debility,
and perhaps deranged by indulging
Appetite beyond the bounds of moderation.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Indigestion</span> will sometimes overtake the
most experienced Epicure;&mdash;when the gus<span class="pagenum" title="158"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158"></a></span>tatory
nerves are in good humour, Hunger
and Savoury Viands will sometimes seduce
the Tongue of a &ldquo;<i>Grand Gourmand</i>&rdquo; to
betray the interest of his Stomach<a name="FNanchor_69_69" id="FNanchor_69_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69_69" class="fnanchor">69</a> in spite
of his Brains.</p>

<p>On such an unfortunate occasion,&mdash;whether
the intestinal commotion be excited
by having eaten too much, or too strong
food&mdash;lie down&mdash;have your Tea early after
Dinner&mdash;and drink it warm.</p>

<p>This is a hint to help the Invalid, whose
digestion is so delicate, that it is sometimes
disordered by a Meal of the strictest Temperance.
If the anxiety, &amp;c. about the
Stomach does not speedily abate, apply the
&ldquo;<i>Stomach Warmer</i>.&rdquo; This valuable companion
to Aged and Gouty Subjects, may
be procured at No. 58, Haymarket.</p>

<p>A certain degree of Heat is absolutely
necessary to excite and support a regular<span class="pagenum" title="159"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159"></a></span>
process of Digestion;&mdash;when the Circulation
is languid, and the food difficult of
solution, in Aged persons and Invalids,&mdash;<i>External
Heat</i> will considerably assist Concoction,
and the application of this califacient
concave will enable the Digestive organs
to overcome refractory materials,&mdash;and
convert them into laudable Chyle.</p>

<p>Unless the Constitution is so confoundedly
debilitated, that the Circulation cannot
run alone&mdash;<i>Abstinence</i><a name="FNanchor_70_70" id="FNanchor_70_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70_70" class="fnanchor">70</a> is the easiest&mdash;cheapest&mdash;and
best cure for the disorders
which arise from <i>Indigestion</i> or <i>Intemperance</i>.
I do not mean what Celsus calls the first
degree of it, &ldquo;when the sick man takes
nothing,&rdquo; but the second, &ldquo;when he takes
nothing but what he ought.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Chylopoietic organs are uncomfort<span class="pagenum" title="160"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160"></a></span>able
when entirely unoccupied,&mdash;when the
Stomach is too tired to work, and too
weak to be employed on actual service,&mdash;it
desires something to be introduced to
it, that will entertain it till it recovers its
energy.</p>

<p>After <span class="smcap">intemperate Feasting</span> one day,
let the food of the following day be Liquid,
or of such materials as are easy of solution.</p>

<p>Various expedients have been recommended
for preventing and relieving the
disorders arising from too copious libations
of &ldquo;the Regal purple Stream.&rdquo;</p>

<p>When a good fellow has been sacrificing
rather too liberally at the shrine of the Jolly
God, the best remedy to help the Stomach to
get rid of its burthen, is to take for Supper
some <span class="smcap">Gruel</span>, (No. 572, <i>see <a href="#Gruel">Index</a></i>,) with
half an ounce of Butter, and a teaspoonful of
<i>Epsom Salt</i> in it; or two or three <i>Peristaltic
Persuaders</i>,&mdash;which some Gastropholists
take as a provocative to appetite, about
an hour before Dinner.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="161"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161"></a></span>
Some persons take as a &ldquo;<i>sequitur</i>&rdquo; a
drachm of <i>Carbonate of Soda</i>.</p>

<p>Others a teaspoonful of <i>Calcined Magnesia</i>:&mdash;when
immediate relief is required, never
administer this uncertain medicine, which,
if the Stomach has no Acid ready to dissolve
it,&mdash;will remain inert; it must be taken, only
when <i>Heart-burn</i> and symptoms of Acidity
are manifest.</p>

<p>As a <i>Finale</i> to the day of the Feast, or the
<i>Overture</i> of the day after, take (No. 481*,)
or two drachms of <i>Epsom Salt</i> in half a pint
of <i>Beef Tea</i>,&mdash;or some <i>Tincture of Rhubarb</i>
in hot water,&mdash;the first thing to be done, is
to endeavour to get rid of the offending material.</p>

<p>A Breakfast of <i>Beef Tea</i><a name="FNanchor_71_71" id="FNanchor_71_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71_71" class="fnanchor">71</a> (No. 563,) is an
<span class="pagenum" title="162"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162"></a></span>
excellent Restorative;&mdash;when <i>the Languor
following Hard Drinking</i> is very distressing,
indulge in the horizontal posture; (see
<i>Siesta</i>, <a href="#THE_SIESTA">p. <ins title="Transcriber&rsquo;s Note: original reads &lsquo;294&rsquo;">94</ins></a>;) nothing relieves it so effectually,
or so soon cheers the Circulation,
and sets all right;&mdash;get an early Luncheon
of restorative Broth or Soup.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hard Drinking</span> <i>is doubly debilitating,
when pursued beyond the usual hour of retiring
to Rest.</i></p>

<p>Those devotees to the Bottle, who never
suffer the orgies of Bacchus to encroach on
the time which Nature demands for Sleep,&mdash;escape
with impunity, many of the evils<span class="pagenum" title="163"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163"></a></span>
which soon&mdash;and irreparably&mdash;impair the
Health of the Midnight reveller.</p>

<p>A facetious observer of the inordinate degree
in which some people will indulge their
Palate, to the gratification of which they
sacrifice all their other senses,&mdash;recommends
such to have their Soup seasoned with a
tasteless purgative, as the Food of insane
persons sometimes is, and so prepare their
bowels for the hard work they are going to
give them!!</p>

<p>To let the Stomach have a holiday occasionally&mdash;<i>i. e.</i>
a Liquid diet, of Broth and
Vegetable Soup, is one of the most agreeable
and most wholesome ways of restoring its
Tone.</p>

<p><i>If your Appetite<a name="FNanchor_72_72" id="FNanchor_72_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72_72" class="fnanchor">72</a> be languid</i>, take additional
<span class="pagenum" title="164"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164"></a></span>
Exercise in a pure open Air,&mdash;or
Dine half an hour later than usual, and so
give time for the Gastric Juices to assemble
in full force;&mdash;or dine upon Fish&mdash;or <i>Chinese
Soup</i>, <i>i. e.</i> Tea.</p>

<p>If these simple means are ineffectual,&mdash;the
next step, is to produce energetic vibration
in the Alimentary tube, without exciting
inordinate action, or debilitating depletion;
and to empty the Bowels, without irritating
them.</p>

<p>Sometimes <i>when the languor occasioned by
Dyspepsia, &amp;c. is extreme</i>, the Torpor of the<span class="pagenum" title="165"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165"></a></span>
System becomes so tremendous&mdash;that no
Stimulus will help it, and the Heart feels as
if it was tired of beating&mdash;a moderate dose
of a quickly operating Aperient, <i>i. e.</i> half an
ounce of Tincture of Rhubarb, and two
drachms of Epsom Salts in a tumbler of
hot water&mdash;will speedily restore its wonted
energy.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Stomach</span> is the centre of Sympathy;&mdash;if
the most minute fibre of the human
frame be hurt, intelligence of the injury instantaneously
arrives;&mdash;and the Stomach is
disturbed, in proportion to the importance
of the Member, and the degree in which it
is offended.</p>

<p>If either the Body or the Mind be fatigued,&mdash;the
Stomach invariably sympathizes;&mdash;if
the most robust do any thing too much, the
Stomach is soon affronted,&mdash;and does too
little:&mdash;unless this mainspring of Health
be in perfect adjustment, the machinery of
life will vibrate with languor;&mdash;especially
those parts which are naturally weak, or<span class="pagenum" title="166"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166"></a></span>
have been injured by Accidents, &amp;c. Constipation
is increased in costive habits&mdash;and
Diarrh&#339;a in such as are subject thereto&mdash;and
all Chronic complaints are exasperated,
especially in persons past the age of 35
years.</p>

<p>Of the various helps to Science, none perhaps
more rapidly facilitate the acquirement
of knowledge, than analogical reasoning;
or illustrating an Art we are ignorant of, by
one we are acquainted with.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Human Frame</span> may be compared
to a Watch, of which the Heart is the Mainspring&mdash;the
Stomach the regulator,&mdash;and
what we put into it, the Key by which the
machine is wound up;&mdash;<i>according to the
quantity,&mdash;quality,&mdash;and proper digestion of
what we Eat<a name="FNanchor_73_73" id="FNanchor_73_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73_73" class="fnanchor">73</a> and Drink, will be the pace of</i>
<span class="pagenum" title="167"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167"></a></span>
<i>the Pulse, and the action of the System in
general</i>:&mdash;when we observe a due proportion
between the quantum of Exercise and that
of Excitement, all goes well.&mdash;If the machine
be disordered, the same expedients
are employed for its re-adjustment, as are
used by the Watch-maker; it must be carefully
cleaned, and judiciously oiled.</p>

<p>Eating <i>Salads</i> after Dinner,&mdash;and chilling
the Stomach, and checking the process of
digestion by swilling cold <i>Soda Water</i>&mdash;we
hold to be other Vulgar Errors.</p>

<p>It is your superfluous <span class="smcap">Second Courses</span>,&mdash;and
ridiculous variety of Wines,&mdash;Liqueurs,&mdash;Ices,
Desserts, &amp;c.&mdash;which (are served up
more to gratify the pride of the Host, than the
appetite of the Guests that) <i>overcome the Stomach,
and paralyze Digestion</i>, and seduce
&ldquo;Children of larger Growth&rdquo; to sacrifice the
health and comfort of several days&mdash;for the<span class="pagenum" title="168"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168"></a></span>
Baby-pleasure of tickling their tongue for a
few minutes, with Trifles and Custards!!</p>

<p>Most of those who have written on what&mdash;by
a strange perversion of language&mdash;are
most non-naturally termed the non-naturals,&mdash;have
merely laid before the Public a nonsensical
register of the peculiarities of their

<p><span class="pagenum" title="169"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169"></a></span>
Some omnivorous Cormorants have such an
ever-craving Appetite, that they are raging
with hunger as soon as they open their Eyes,&mdash;and
bolt half a dozen hard Eggs before
they are well awake;&mdash;Others are so perfectly
restored by that &ldquo;chief nourisher in
Life&rsquo;s feast,&rdquo; Balmy Sleep, that they do not
think about Eating,&mdash;till they have been up
and actively employed for several hours.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="170"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170"></a></span>
The strong Food, which the strong action
of strong bodies requires&mdash;would soon destroy
weak ones,&mdash;if the latter attempt to
follow the example of the former,&mdash;instead
of feeling invigorated, their Stomachs will
be as oppressed, as a Porter is with a load
that is too heavy for him,&mdash;and, under the
idea of swallowing what are called strengthening
nourishing things,&mdash;will very soon
make themselves ready for the Undertaker.</p>

<p>Some people seem to think, that the more
plentifully they stuff themselves, the better
they must thrive, and the stronger they must
grow.</p>

<p>It is not the quantity that we swallow,&mdash;but
that which is properly digested, which
nourishes us.</p>

<p>A Moderate Meal well digested, renders
the body vigorous,&mdash;glutting it with superfluity,
(which is only turned into excrement
instead of aliment, and if not speedily evacuated,)
not only oppresses the System, but
produces all sorts of Disorders.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="171"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171"></a></span>
Some are continually inviting <i>Indigestion</i>,&mdash;by
eating <i>Water-cresses</i>, or other undressed
Vegetables<a name="FNanchor_75_75" id="FNanchor_75_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75_75" class="fnanchor">75</a>, &ldquo;to sweeten their Blood,&rdquo;&mdash;or
<i>Oysters</i> &ldquo;to enrich it.&rdquo;&mdash;Others fancy their
Dinner cannot digest till they have closed
the orifice of their Stomachs with a certain
portion of <i>Cheese</i>,&mdash;if the preceding Dinner
has been a light one, a little bit of Cheese
after it may not do much harm, but its
character for encouraging concoction is undeserved,&mdash;there
is not a more absurd Vulgar
Error, than the often quoted proverb, that</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;Cheese is a surly Elf,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Digesting all things, but itself.&rdquo;</span>
</div></div>

<p>A Third never eats Goose, &amp;c. without remembering
that <i>Brandy</i> or <i>Cayenne</i> is the
Latin for it.</p>

<p>A much less portion of Stimulus is necessary
after a hearty meal of califactive ma<span class="pagenum" title="172"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172"></a></span>terials,
such as good Beef or Mutton&mdash;than
after a <i>maigre</i> Dinner of Fish, &amp;c.</p>

<p>Another <i>Vulgar Error</i> in the school of Good
Living, is, that &ldquo;<i>Good eating</i> requires <i>Good
drinking</i>.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Good</i> eating generally implies
<i>high</i> seasoned Viands,&mdash;the savoury Herbs,
and stimulating Spices with which these
<i>Haut-Gouts</i> are sprinkled and stuffed, &amp;c.
are sufficient to encourage the digestive faculties
to work &ldquo;<i>con amore</i>&rdquo; without any
&ldquo;<i>douceur</i>&rdquo; of Vinous irrigation,&mdash;but many
persons make it a rule, after eating Pig, &amp;c.
to take a glass of <i>Liqueur</i>, or <i>Eau de Vie</i>, &amp;c.&mdash;or,
as when used in this manner, it would
be as properly called, &ldquo;<i>eau de mort</i>.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Indigestion</span>, or, to use the term of the
day, <span class="smcap">A Bilious Attack</span>,&mdash;<i>as often arises
from over-exertion, or</i> <span class="smcap">Anxiety Of Mind</span>,&mdash;as
from refractory Food; it frequently
produces <span class="smcap">Flatulence</span><a name="FNanchor_76_76" id="FNanchor_76_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76_76" class="fnanchor">76</a>, and flatulence
<span class="pagenum" title="173"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173"></a></span>
produces <i>Palpitation of the Heart</i>; which is
most difficult to stop, when it comes on
about an hour or two after a Meal;&mdash;the
Stomach seems incapable of proceeding in
its business, from being over-distended with
wind, which pressing on the Heart and larger
vessels, obstructs the Circulation:&mdash;as soon
as this flatulence is dispelled, all goes well
again:&mdash;inflating the Lungs to the utmost,
<i>i. e.</i> taking in as much breath as you can,
and holding it as long as you can, will sometimes
act as a counterbalance, and produce
relief.</p>

<p>This is the first thing to do when this distressing
Spasm attacks you,&mdash;if it is not
immediately checked; take a strong <i>Peppermint</i>,
or <i>Ginger Lozenge</i>, (see <a href='#Page_99'>page 99</a>,) sit,
<span class="pagenum" title="174"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174"></a></span>&mdash;or
if possible lie down and loosen all ligatures;
the horizontal posture and perfect
quiet are grand Panaceas in this disorder;&mdash;if
these do not soon settle it, drink some
stimulus: sometimes a teacupful of <i>Hot water</i>,
with a teaspoonful of common salt in it, will
suffice,&mdash;or a couple of glasses of <i>Wine</i>,&mdash;or
one of <i>Brandy</i> in one of hot water: either
of these will generally soon restore sufficient
energy to the Stomach, to enable it to expel
the enemy that offends it, and set the circulation
to work freely again.&mdash;If these means
are not immediately efficacious, take half an
ounce of <i>Tincture of Rhubarb</i> in a quarter
pint of hot water,&mdash;or three or four
<i>Peristaltic Persuaders</i>, with half a pint of
hot water.</p>

<p>If this complaint comes on when the
Bowels are costive,&mdash;they must be put into
motion as speedily as possible, by some of
the means recommended in the following
pages.</p>

<p>It will sometimes come on during the<span class="pagenum" title="175"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175"></a></span>
collapsed state of the system, from <span class="lowercase smcap">FASTING
TOO LONG</span>.</p>

<p><i>Those who take no Food between an early</i>
<span class="smcap">Breakfast</span>&mdash;<i>and a late</i> <span class="smcap">Dinner</span>,&mdash;for
fear, as they term it, of spoiling the latter
meal,&mdash;generally complain of <i>Flatulence</i>,&mdash;<i>Languor</i>,
<i>Lowness of Spirits</i>, &amp;c. (and those
who are troubled by a <i>Cough</i>, have often a
paroxysm of it,) for the hour or more before
Dinner;&mdash;and <i>Heartburn</i>, &amp;c. after it:&mdash;the
former arising from fasting too long, the
latter from indulging an Appetite so over
excited, that a Baron of Beef, a Pail of
Port Wine, and a Tubful of Tea, will hardly
satisfy it.</p>

<p>The languor of <i>Inanition</i>, and the fever
of <i>Repletion</i>, may be easily avoided by eating
a <span class="smcap">Luncheon</span>,&mdash;solid and nutritive, in proportion
as the <span class="smcap">Dinner</span> is protracted, and
the activity of the Exercise to be taken in
the mean-time.</p>

<p>The oftener you eat, the less ought to be
eaten at a time; and the less you eat at a
time, the oftener you ought to eat:&mdash;<i>a weak</i><span class="pagenum" title="176"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176"></a></span>
<i>Stomach</i> has a much better chance of digesting
two light meals, than one heavy one.</p>

<p>The Stomach should be allowed time to
empty itself, before we fill it again.</p>

<p>There is not only a considerable difference
in the digestibility of various Foods,&mdash;but
also of the time required by different
Stomachs to digest them&mdash;the sign of which,
is the return of Appetite.</p>

<p>The digestion of Aliment is perfect, and
quickly performed, in proportion to the
keenness of our Appetite at the time of
taking it&mdash;more or less perfect Mastication&mdash;and
the vigorous state of the organs of
Digestion,&mdash;as a general rule, <i>the interval
of Fasting</i> should seldom be less than three,
nor more than five hours<a name="FNanchor_77_77" id="FNanchor_77_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77_77" class="fnanchor">77</a>,&mdash;Digestion
<span class="pagenum" title="177"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177"></a></span>
being generally completed within that
time.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="178"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178"></a></span>
The Fashion of A.D. 1820 has introduced
a much longer fast (&ldquo;a windy recreation,&rdquo;
as father Paul assures the lay brother) than
even the elasticity of robust Health can
endure, without distressing the adjustment
of the System,&mdash;and creating such an over-excited
appetite, that the Stomach does not
feel it has had enough,&mdash;till it finds that it
has been crammed too much<a name="FNanchor_78_78" id="FNanchor_78_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78_78" class="fnanchor">78</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="179"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179"></a></span></p>
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;When Hunger<a name="FNanchor_79_79" id="FNanchor_79_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79_79" class="fnanchor">79</a> calls, obey, nor often wait<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till hunger sharpen to corrosive pain;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For the keen appetite will feast beyond<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What nature well can bear.&rdquo;</span>
</div></div>

<p>This important truth&mdash;we would most
strongly press on the consideration of Those
who attend our <span class="smcap">Courts of Law</span>, and <span class="smcap">Parliament</span>.</p>

<p>Many industrious Professional men, in
order to add a few pounds to their Income&mdash;in
a few years are quite worn out&mdash;from
their digestive faculties being continually
disordered and fretted for want of <i>regular</i>
supplies of <i>Food</i>; and sufficient <i>Sleep</i>.</p>

<p>An Egg boiled in the shell for five minutes,
or <i>Les Tablettes de Bouillon</i> (No. 252), and a
bit of Bread, is a convenient provision against<span class="pagenum" title="180"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180"></a></span>
the former&mdash;<i>the Siesta</i> (see <a href='#Page_94'>page 94</a>) is the
best Antidote for the latter.</p>

<p>The sensation of <i>Hunger</i> arises from the
Gastric juices acting upon the coats of the
Stomach&mdash;how injurious it must be to fast
so long, that by neglecting to supply it with
some alimentary substance which this fluid
was formed to dissolve,&mdash;the Stomach becomes
in danger of being digested itself!!!</p>

<p>Those who feel a gnawing, as they call it,
in their Stomach, should not wait till the
stated hour of dinner, but eat a little forthwith,
that the Stomach may have something
to work upon.</p>

<p>By <i>too long Fasting</i>, Wind accumulates in
the Stomach, especially of those who have
passed the meridian of Life&mdash;and produces
a distressing Flatulence&mdash;Languor&mdash;Faintness&mdash;Giddiness&mdash;Palpitation
of the Heart,
&amp;c.</p>

<p>If the Morning has been occupied by
anxiety in Business,&mdash;or the Mind or Body is
fatigued by over-exertion&mdash;these symptoms<span class="pagenum" title="181"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181"></a></span>
will sometimes come on about an hour or
two before the usual time of Dining,&mdash;well
masticating a bit of Biscuit, and letting a
strong Peppermint Lozenge (see <a href='#Page_99'>page 99</a>)
dissolve in the mouth as soon as you feel the
first symptoms of Flatulence,&mdash;will often
pacify the Stomach, and prevent the increase
of these complaints.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Whytt</span>, whose observations on
<i>Nervous Disorders</i>, (like this work), are
valuable, inasmuch as they are the authentic
narrative of his own Experience&mdash;says, page
344, &ldquo;When my Stomach has been weak,
after I have been indisposed, I have often
found myself much better for a glass of
Claret and a bit of bread, an hour or more
before Dinner, and I have ordered it in the
same way to others, and again in the evening,
an hour or more before Supper, with advantage.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There is no doubt of the propriety of <span class="smcap">Dr</span>.
W.&rsquo;s prescription, the Editor&rsquo;s own feelings
bear witness to it. For those who are just<span class="pagenum" title="182"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182"></a></span>
recovering from Diseases which have left
them in a state of great Debility, a <a id="glass_of_Wine"></a>glass of
Wine and a bit of Bread,&mdash;or a cup of good
<i>Beef Tea</i>, (see <a href='#Page_96'>page 96</a>) are perhaps as good
<span class="smcap">Tonics</span> as any,&mdash;they not only remove
Languor, but at the same time furnish Nutriment.</p>

<p>We have known weak Stomachs, when
kept fasting beyond the time they expected,&mdash;become
so exhausted&mdash;they would refuse to
receive any solid Food,&mdash;until restored to
good temper,&mdash;and wound up by some
Wine, or other stimulus&mdash;as Instinct proposed.</p>

<p>Feeble Persons, who are subject to such
sudden attacks, should always travel armed
with a <i>Pocket Pistol</i> charged with a couple
of glasses of White Wine, or, &ldquo;<i>Veritable
Eau de Vie</i>,&rdquo;&mdash;a Biscuit, and some strong
Peppermint or Ginger Lozenges, or see &ldquo;<i>Tablettes
de Bouillon</i>&rdquo; (No. 252):&mdash;when their
Stomach is uneasy from emptiness, &amp;c.
these crutches will support the Circulation,&mdash;and<span class="pagenum" title="183"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183"></a></span>
considerably diminish, and sometimes
entirely prevent the distressing effects which
Invalids suffer from too long a Fast<a name="FNanchor_80_80" id="FNanchor_80_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80_80" class="fnanchor">80</a>.</p>

What a contrast there is between the materials
of the morning meal A.D. 1550, when
Queen Elizabeth&rsquo;s Maids of Honour began
the day with a <i>Round of Beef</i>,&mdash;or a <i>Red
Herring</i>, and a <i>flaggon of Ale</i>&mdash;and in 1821,
when the Sportsman, and even the day-Labourer,
breakfast on what Cooks call
&ldquo;<i>Chinese Soup</i>,&rdquo; i. e. Tea.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Swift</span> has jocosely observed, such is the

to the East for Tea, and to the West for
Sugar.</p>

<p>In <span class="smcap">The Northumberland Household
Book</span> for 1512, we are informed that &ldquo;<i>a

5<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i> per quarter.</p>

<p>That distressing interruption of the Cir<span class="pagenum" title="189"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189"></a></span>culation,
which is called &ldquo;<span class="smcap">Nightmare</span>,&rdquo;
&ldquo;Globus Hystericus,&rdquo; &ldquo;Spasms,&rdquo; &ldquo;Cramp,&rdquo;
or &ldquo;Gout,&rdquo; in the Stomach, with which few
who have passed the Meridian of Life<a name="FNanchor_83_83" id="FNanchor_83_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83_83" class="fnanchor">83</a>, are
<span class="pagenum" title="190"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190"></a></span>
so fortunate as not to be too well acquainted,
we believe to arise from the same causes&mdash;which
in the day produce Palpitation of the
Heart.</p>

<p>The Editor is now in his forty-third year,
and has been from his youth occasionally
afflicted with both these disorders; sometimes
without being able to imagine what
has produced them:&mdash;sometimes he has not
been attacked with either of these complaints
for many months; they have then seized him
for a week or more,&mdash;and as unaccountably
ceased.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Nightmare</span> has generally come on
about three o&rsquo;clock in the morning,&mdash;at the
termination of the first, or rather at the commencement
of the second sleep;&mdash;quite as
often when he has taken only a liquid or
very light supper,&mdash;as when he has eaten<span class="pagenum" title="191"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191"></a></span>
some solid food, and gone to bed soon after;&mdash;and
most frequently after he has Dined<a name="FNanchor_84_84" id="FNanchor_84_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84_84" class="fnanchor">84</a>
out: not from the quantity, but the quality
of the food and drink he has taken, the
change of the time of taking it. The fatigue
attending his performance of Amphytrion
at his own table, has also occasionally produced
it.</p>

<p>It appears to be occasioned by want of
Action in the System, being generally preceded
by Languor&mdash;(which, if not removed,
may proceed to produce&mdash;<i>Palsy</i>&mdash;or <i>Death</i>,)
caused either by depression of the power of<span class="pagenum" title="192"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192"></a></span>
the Heart by anxiety,&mdash;obstruction of the
peristaltic motion by the oppression of indigestible
matter,&mdash;or interruption of the performance
of the Restorative Process.</p>

<p>It is certainly not to be prevented by Abstinence,
for during the time that the Editor
was trying the effect of a spare diet, he was
most frequently afflicted with it.&mdash;See <i>Obs.</i>
on <span class="smcap"><a href="#SLEEP">Sleep</a></span>, &amp;c. It is only to be relieved by
Stimulants, and in an extreme case&mdash;by
quickly acting Aperients, &amp;c. See following
pages.</p>

<p>Some persons are peculiarly subject to it
when they lie on their back,&mdash;others if on
their left side:&mdash;when the Editor has any
disposition to this malady, it is certainly
exasperated if he lays upon his right side,&mdash;especially
during the first part of the Night,&mdash;it
is a good Custom to lay one half of the
Night on one side, and the other half on the
other.</p>

<p>When this appalling pause of the Circulation
takes place&mdash;he wakes, with the idea<span class="pagenum" title="193"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193"></a></span>
that another minute of such suspended action
will terminate his Existence:&mdash;his first recourse
is to force the action of the Lungs
by breathing as quick and as deep as possible.&mdash;He
feels very languid,&mdash;and to prevent
a return of the fit, drinks a couple of
glasses of <i>White Wine</i>,&mdash;or half a wine-glass
of <i>Brandy</i>, in a wine-glass of <i>Peppermint
Water</i>.</p>

<p>Sometimes the Disorder does not terminate
with one paroxysm, but recurs as
soon as Sleep returns:&mdash;when this is the
case, get half a tumbler of Hot Water, add
to it a wine-glass of <i>Peppermint Water</i>, and
half that quantity of <i>Tincture of Rhubarb</i>, or
fifty drops of <i>Sal Volatile</i>, or both.</p>

<p>The symptom of security from a repetition
of the Fit, is a vermicular sensation, betokening
that the peristaltic motion, and the Circulation
is restored to its regular pace again.</p>

<p>His belief that many sudden and unaccountable
Deaths in the night have arisen
from Invalids not knowing how to manage<span class="pagenum" title="194"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194"></a></span>
this Disorder, induces the Editor to relate
his own personal experience concerning it&mdash;and
the Remedies which he has found effectual
to remove it.</p>

<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Non ignara mali, miseris succurrere disco.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>

<p>The case is very similar to what Dr. <span class="smcap">Whytt</span>
relates of himself, in his <i>Observations on
Nervous, Hysteric, and Hypochondriac Disorders</i>,
8vo. 1767<a name="FNanchor_85_85" id="FNanchor_85_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85_85" class="fnanchor">85</a>; by which, Dr. <span class="smcap">Cullen</span>,
<span class="pagenum" title="195"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195"></a></span>
in p. 10 of his <i>Clinical Lectures</i>, says, &ldquo;he
has done more than all his predecessors.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Waller</span> has written a very sensible
Essay on the <i>Nightmare</i>&mdash;those who are
much afflicted with it, cannot lay out 3<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>
better, than in buying his book&mdash;12mo. 1816.
He says, &ldquo;it most frequently proceeds from
acidity in the Stomach, and recommends
<i>Carbonate of Soda</i>, to be taken in the Beer<span class="pagenum" title="196"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196"></a></span>
you Drink at dinner.&rdquo; He tells us &ldquo;he derived
his information, as to the cause, and
cure of this distressing disorder, from a personal
acquaintance with it for many years.&rdquo;</p>

<p>How devoutly it is to be wished that
all Authors would follow good old <span class="smcap">Sydenham</span>
and Mr. <span class="smcap">Waller&rsquo;s</span> example,&mdash;and
give us a register of the progress of those
chronic complaints which they have themselves
been afflicted with, and the regimen,
&amp;c. which they have found most effectual to
alleviate and cure them;&mdash;and, instead of
what they think,&mdash;write only what they
know,&mdash;as the pains-taking <span class="smcap">Sanctorius</span>&mdash;<span class="smcap">Spallanzani</span>&mdash;<span class="smcap">Bryan
Robinson</span>,&mdash;and the persevering and minutely accurately
observing Dr. <span class="smcap">Stark</span> have in their <i>Dietetical
Experiments</i>.</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Whytt</span> has immortalized himself by
the candid relation of his own infirmities,
and his circumstantial account of the Regimen,
&amp;c. which enabled him to bear up
against them,&mdash;which forms the most va<span class="pagenum" title="197"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197"></a></span>luable
collection of observations on <i>Nervous
Complaints</i>, that experience and liberality
have yet presented to the public.</p>

<p><i>One page of</i> <span class="lowercase smcap">PERSONAL EXPERIENCE</span>, <i>is
worth folios of theoretic Fancies</i>,&mdash;<i>or Clinical
Cases</i>, which can only be illuminated by the
twilight of conjecture:&mdash;they may be faithful
narratives of the accounts given by Patients,
yet, as these are very often imposed
upon by their imagination attributing effects
to very different causes than those which
produce them, they are often very inaccurate
deductions.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Delicate and the Nervous</span>, will
derive the greatest advantage from keeping
<i>a Register of their Health</i>,&mdash;they should
note, and avoid whatever disagrees with them,&mdash;and
endeavour to ascertain, what kind and
quantity of Food&mdash;Exercise&mdash;Occupation
and Pleasures, &amp;c. are most agreeable to
their constitution, and take them at those
regular periods which appear most convenient
to them. However this advice may excite<span class="pagenum" title="198"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198"></a></span>
the smiles of those who are swelling &ldquo;in all
the pride of superfluous Health,&rdquo; such methodical
movements will considerably improve
the enjoyment, and prolong the life of
the Valetudinary and the Aged: for whom,
Instinct is the best Guide in the choice of
Aliment.</p>

<p>None but the most obstinately ignorant
Visionary, would dream of laying down absolute
Rules<a name="FNanchor_86_86" id="FNanchor_86_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_86_86" class="fnanchor">86</a> for governing the caprice and
<span class="pagenum" title="199"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199"></a></span>
whims of the infirm Stomachs of Crazy Valetudinarians.
Codes of Dietetics<a name="FNanchor_87_87" id="FNanchor_87_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87_87" class="fnanchor">87</a> are almost
useless,&mdash;the suggestions of Reason are
often in direct opposition to the desires of
Appetite.</p>

<p>In most matters regarding the adjustment
of that supreme organ of existence,&mdash;the<span class="pagenum" title="200"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200"></a></span>
<span class="smcap">Stomach</span>,&mdash;&ldquo;honest Instinct<a name="FNanchor_88_88" id="FNanchor_88_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88_88" class="fnanchor">88</a> comes a
Volunteer.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Ventriloquism</i> seldom falls to
make out a fair title, to be called &ldquo;unerring.&rdquo;<span class="pagenum" title="201"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201"></a></span>
A due respect to the suggestions of Instinct,
every Invalid will find highly advantageous,&mdash;natural<span class="pagenum" title="202"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202"></a></span>
longing has frequently pointed out
Food&mdash;by which <i>Acute Diseases</i> have been
cured, when the most consummate medical
skill was at fault, and Life at its lowest ebb.</p>

<p>It is needless to insist upon the importance
of Diet and Regimen in <i>Chronic Disorders</i>.</p>

<p>Be content with <span class="smcap">One</span><a name="FNanchor_89_89" id="FNanchor_89_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89_89" class="fnanchor">89</a> Dish,&mdash;from want
of submission to this salutary rule of Temperance&mdash;as
<span class="pagenum" title="203"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203"></a></span>
many men dig their Grave
with their <i>Teeth</i>, as with the <i>Tankard</i>;&mdash;<span class="smcap">Drunkenness</span>
is deplorably destructive,
but her demurer sister <span class="smcap">Gluttony</span> destroys
an hundred to her one.</p>

<p><i>Instinct</i> speaks pretty plainly to those
whose instruments of Digestion are in a delicate
state&mdash;and is an infinitely surer guide
than any Dietetic rules that can be contrived.</p>

<p>That the Food which we fancy most&mdash;generally
sits easiest on the Stomach&mdash;is a
fact which the experience of almost every
individual can confirm.</p>

<p>The functions of Digestion go on merrily
when exercised by Aliment which the Stomach
asks for&mdash;they often labour in vain
when we eat merely because it is the usual<span class="pagenum" title="204"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204"></a></span>
hour of Dining&mdash;or out of necessity, to
amuse the Gastric juices, and &ldquo;lull the
grinding stomach&rsquo;s hungry rage.&rdquo;</p>

<p>To affirm that any thing is wholesome, or
unwholesome,&mdash;without considering the subject
in all the circumstances to which it bears
relation, and the unaccountable peculiarities
of different Constitutions,&mdash;is, with submission,
talking nonsense.</p>

<p>Let every Man consult his Stomach;&mdash;to
eat and drink such things&mdash;and in such quantities&mdash;as
agree with that perfectly well, is
wholesome for him, whilst they continue to do
so<a name="FNanchor_90_90" id="FNanchor_90_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90_90" class="fnanchor">90</a>:&mdash;that which satisfies and refreshes us,
and causes no uneasiness after, may safely be
taken in moderation&mdash;whenever the Appetite
is keen&mdash;whether it be at Dinner or Supper.</p>

<p>What we have been longest used to, is
most likely to agree with us best.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="205"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205"></a></span>
The wholesomeness, &amp;c. of all Food, depends
very much on the quality of it&mdash;and
the way in which it is cooked.</p>

<p>Those who are poor in Health, must live
as they can;&mdash;certainly the less Stimulus any
of us use the better, provided it be sufficient
to properly carry on the Circulation:&mdash;I
sometimes hold it lawful to excite Appetite
when it is feeble by Age, or debilitated by
Indisposition.</p>

<p>Those Stimuli which excite the circulation
at the least expense of nervous irritation&mdash;and
afford the greatest quantity of nutriment,
must be most acceptable to the Stomach,
when it demands restorative diet.</p>

<p>A healthful impetus may be given to the
System by a well seasoned <i>Soup</i>, or a restorative
<i>Ragout</i>, at half the expense to the
machinery of Life, than by the use of those
Spirituous Stimuli&mdash;which fan a feverish
fire&mdash;exciting action without supplying the
expenditure of the principle producing it&mdash;and
merely quicken the circulation for a few
minutes, without contributing any material<span class="pagenum" title="206"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206"></a></span>
to feed the Lamp of Life&mdash;which, if it be
originally or organically defective&mdash;or is
impaired by Time or Disease&mdash;will sometimes
not burn brightly, unless it be supplied
with the best oil, and trimmed in the most
skilful manner.</p>

<p>Good <i>Mock Turtle</i>, see (No. 246, or 247*,)
will agree with weak stomachs surprisingly
well; so will that made by <span class="smcap">Birch</span> <i>in Cornhill</i>,
and by <span class="smcap">Kay</span> <i>at Albion House</i>, Aldersgate
Street.&mdash;This excellent Soup, is frequently
ordered for Dyspeptic patients, by the senior
Physician to one of the largest hospitals in
this Metropolis: as a man of science and
talent, certainly in as high estimation as any
of his cotemporaries.</p>

<p>Ox-tail Soup (No. 240,) Giblet Soup
(No. 244,) and (No. 87,) and (No. 89,)
(No. 489,) and (No. 503,) are very agreeable
extempore Restoratives,&mdash;so easy of digestion,
that they are a sinecure to the
Stomach, and give very little trouble to the
chylopoietic organs&mdash;those whose Teeth are
defective&mdash;and those whose Circulation is<span class="pagenum" title="207"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207"></a></span>
below <i>par</i>,&mdash;will find them acceptable Foods.
&ldquo;<i>Experto crede</i>,&rdquo;&mdash;the reader will remember
<i>Baglivi&rsquo;s</i> chapter &ldquo;<i>de Idolis Medicorum</i>,&rdquo;
wherein he tells us, that &ldquo;Physicians always
prescribe to others, what they like themselves.&rdquo;
The learned <span class="smcap">Mandeville</span> has
favoured us with five pages on the incomparably
invigorating virtues of <i>Stock Fish</i>!!
a kind of Cod which is dried without being
salted. See pages 316, &amp;c. of his <i>Treatise
on Hypochondriasis</i>.</p>

<p>The best Answers, to all inquiries about
<i>The Wholesomes</i>, are the following Questions;&mdash;&ldquo;Do
you like it?&rdquo; &ldquo;Does it agree with
you?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;then eat in moderation, and you
cannot do very wrong.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Those who have long lived luxuriously,
to be sufficiently nourished, must be regularly
supplied with Food that is nutritive,
and Drink that is stimulating<a name="FNanchor_91_91" id="FNanchor_91_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_91_91" class="fnanchor">91</a>,&mdash;<i>Spice and</i>
<span class="pagenum" title="208"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208"></a></span>
<i>Wine</i>, are as needful to the &ldquo;<span class="smcap">Bon Vivant</span>&rdquo;
of a certain Age&mdash;as its <i>Mother&rsquo;s Milk</i>, is
to a <span class="smcap">New-born Babe</span>.</p>

<p>The decrease of the energy of Life arises
from the decrease of the action of the organs
of the Body&mdash;especially those of Digestion,&mdash;which
in early life is so intense and perfect,
that a Child, after its common unexcitant
meal of Bread and Milk, is as hilarious and
frolicsome as an Adult person is after a
certain quantity of Roast Beef and Port.</p>

<p>The infirm stomachs of Invalids, require
a little indulgence<a name="FNanchor_92_92" id="FNanchor_92_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_92_92" class="fnanchor">92</a>&mdash;like other bad instruments,
<span class="pagenum" title="209"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209"></a></span>
they often want oiling, and
screwing, and winding up and adjusting
with the utmost care, to keep them in tolerable
order;&mdash;and will receive the most
salutary Stimulus, from now and then
making a full meal of a favourite dish. This
is not a singular notion of my own, though
it may not exactly agree with the fastidious
fancy of <i>Dr. Sangrado&rsquo;s</i> disciples,&mdash;that
Starvation and Phlebotomy, are Sovereign
Remedies for all Disorders.</p>

<p>Those philanthropic Physicians, Dr. Diet,&mdash;Dr.
Quiet,&mdash;and Dr. Merryman,&mdash;hold
the same doctrine as the <i>Magnus Coquus</i>&mdash;<i>i. e.</i>
the Author of &ldquo;the Cook&rsquo;s Oracle,&rdquo; to
whose culinary skill we have been so repeatedly
indebted in the composition of this work.</p>

<p>As excessive Eating and Drinking is certainly
the most frequent cause of the disorders
of the Rich,&mdash;so privation is the
common source of complaints among the
Poor;&mdash;the cause of the one, is the cure
of the other&mdash;but where one of the latter<span class="pagenum" title="210"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210"></a></span>
dies of Want, how many thousands of the
former are destroyed by Indigestion!</p>

<p>If strong Spices and savoury Herbs excite
appetite&mdash;they (in an increased ratio,) accelerate
the action of the Bowels&mdash;and hurry
the food through the alimentary canal, too
rapidly to allow the Absorbents to do their
work properly.</p>

<p><i>Salt</i> is the most salubrious and easily
obtainable relish which Nature has given
us to give sapidity to other substances; and
has this advantage over all other Sauces,
that if taken to excess&mdash;it carries its remedy
with it in its Aperient quality.</p>

<p>We suspect that most mischief is done by
the immoderate and constant use of the
<i>Common Condiments</i>.&mdash;We have seen some
puritanical folks, who are for ever boasting
that <i>They never touch</i> <span class="smcap">Made Dishes</span>, &amp;c.
(one would suppose they had the <i>Tongue of
Pityllus</i><a name="FNanchor_93_93" id="FNanchor_93_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_93_93" class="fnanchor">93</a>,) so be-devil every morsel they put
<span class="pagenum" title="211"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211"></a></span>
into their Mouth&mdash;with <span class="smcap">Pepper</span>, and
<span class="smcap">Mustard</span>, &amp;c. that they made their common
food ten times more <i>piquante</i>&mdash;than the burn-gullet
<i>Bonne Bouche</i> of an eastern Nabob, or
<i>a Broiled Devil</i>, enveloped in &ldquo;veritable
Sauce d&rsquo;Enfer.&rdquo;&mdash;See (No. 355 and 538).</p>

<p>We do not condemn the moderate use
of Spices, but the constant and excessive
abuse of them,&mdash;by which the papillary
nerves of the tongue become so blunted,
that in a little time they lose all relish for
useful nourishing food, and the Epicure
is punished with all the sufferings of incessant
and incurable Indigestion,&mdash;perturbed
Sleep&mdash;and the horrors of the
Night-Mare, &amp;c. &amp;c.&mdash;However, enough has
been written by a thousand cautionists, to
convince any rational creature of the advantage
resulting to both the Body and the
Mind from a simple and frugal fare:&mdash;the<span class="pagenum" title="212"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212"></a></span>
great secret of Health and Longevity
is to keep up the sensibility of the
Stomach.</p>

<p>No Regimen<a name="FNanchor_94_94" id="FNanchor_94_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_94_94" class="fnanchor">94</a> can be contrived that will
suit every body.<span class="pagenum" title="213"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213"></a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I knew a black servant of Mr. Pitt, an
Indian Merchant in America, who was fond<span class="pagenum" title="214"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214"></a></span>
of <span class="smcap">Soup</span> <i>made of</i> <span class="smcap">Rattle Snakes</span>,&mdash;in
which the Head, without any regard to the
Poison, was boiled along with the rest of

<p>No food is so delicious that it pleases all
palates,&mdash;nothing can be more correct than
the old adage, &ldquo;one man&rsquo;s meat is another
man&rsquo;s poison.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It would be as difficult for a Laplander,
or an earth-eating Ottomaque, to convince
our good citizens that Train Oil, and gutter-mud,
is a more elegant relish than their
favourite Turtle&mdash;as for the former to fancy
that Kay or Birch&rsquo;s Soup can be as agreeable
as the Grease and Garbage which custom
has taught them to think delicious.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><span class="pagenum" title="215"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215"></a></span>
&ldquo;Man differs more from Man<br />
Than Man from Beast.&rdquo;&mdash;<span class="smcap">Colman.</span></p>
</blockquote>

<p><i>Celsus</i><a name="FNanchor_95_95" id="FNanchor_95_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_95_95" class="fnanchor">95</a> very sensibly says, that &ldquo;a healthy
man, under his own government, ought not
to tie himself up by strict rules,&mdash;nor to
abstain from any sort of food; that he
ought sometimes to fast, and sometimes
to feast.&rdquo; <i>Sanis, sunt omnia Sana.</i></p>

<p>When the Stomach sends forth eructant
signals of distress, for help against Indigestion,
the <i>Peristaltic Persuaders</i> (see the
<a href="#Page_228">end of this Essay</a>) are as agreeable and<span class="pagenum" title="216"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216"></a></span>
effectual assistance as can be offered; and
for delicate Constitutions, and those that
are impaired by Age or Intemperance, are a
valuable Panacea.</p>

<p>They derive, and deserve this name, from
the peculiar mildness of their operation<a name="FNanchor_96_96" id="FNanchor_96_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_96_96" class="fnanchor">96</a>.
One or two very gently increase the action
of the principal viscera, help them to do
their work a little faster,&mdash;and enable the
Stomach to serve with an ejectment whatever
offends it,&mdash;and move it into the
Bowels.</p>

<p>Thus <i>Indigestion</i> is easily and speedily
removed,&mdash;<i>Appetite</i> restored,&mdash;(the mouths
of the absorbing vessels being cleansed) <i>Nutrition</i>
is facilitated,&mdash;and <i>Strength</i> of Body,
and <i>Energy</i> of Mind<a name="FNanchor_97_97" id="FNanchor_97_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_97_97" class="fnanchor">97</a>, are the happy results.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="217"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217"></a></span>
If an immediate operation be desired, take
some <i>Tincture of Rhubarb</i>&mdash;as a <i>Pill</i> is the
most gentle and gradually operating form for
a drug&mdash;a <i>Tincture</i> in which it is as it were
ready digested, is the most immediate in its
action.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">To Make Tincture of Rhubarb.</span>&mdash;Steep
three ounces of the best Rhubarb
(pounded) and half an ounce of Carraway
Seeds, (pounded) in a bottle of Brandy, for
ten days. A table-spoonful in a wine-glass
of hot water will generally be enough.</p>

<p><i>Compound Tincture of Senna</i>, has been
recommended, especially to those who have
accustomed themselves to the use of spirituous
Liquors and high living. Several
similar preparations are sold under the name
of <i>Daffy&rsquo;s Elixir</i>&mdash;or as much <span class="smcap">Epsom Salt</span>,
in half a pint of <i>hot</i> water, as experience has
informed you, will produce one motion,&mdash;a
Tea-spoonful (<i>i. e.</i> from one to two drachms)
will generally do this&mdash;especially if it be
taken in the morning, fasting, <i>i. e.</i> at least
half an hour before Breakfast.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="218"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218"></a></span>
<i>The best way of covering the taste of</i> <span class="smcap">Salt</span>,
is to put a lump of <i>Sugar</i> and a bit of thin-cut
<i>Lemon Peel</i><a name="FNanchor_98_98" id="FNanchor_98_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_98_98" class="fnanchor">98</a> into the hot water, for a
few minutes before you stir the Salt into it,&mdash;to
which you may add a few grains of
grated <i>Ginger</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Epsom Salt</span> is <i>a very speedy laxative</i>,
often operating within an hour,&mdash;does the
business required of it with great regularity,&mdash;and
is more uniform in what it does,&mdash;and
when it does it,&mdash;than any Aperient;&mdash;ten
minutes after you have taken it, encourage
its operation by drinking half a
pint, or more, of warm water&mdash;weak Broth&mdash;Tea&mdash;thin
Gruel (No. 572), with some<span class="pagenum" title="219"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219"></a></span>
salt and butter in it&mdash;or <i>Soda Water</i>
(No. 481.*) See <a href="#Soda_Water">Index</a>.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>Nil tam ad sanitatem, et longevitatem conducit,
quam crebr√¶ et domestic√¶ purgationes.</i>&rdquo;&mdash;<span class="smcap">Lord
Bacon.</span>&mdash;<i>i. e.</i> &ldquo;Nothing contributes
so much to preserve Health, and prolong
Life, as frequently cleansing the alimentary
canal with gentle laxatives.&rdquo;</p>

<p>We perfectly agree with Lord Bacon, and
believe that in nine cases out of ten, for
which <span class="smcap">Tonic Medicines</span> are administered,
<i>Peristaltic Persuaders</i> will not only much
more certainly improve Appetite,&mdash;but invigorate
the Constitution; by facilitating
the absorption of nutriment,&mdash;which, in
aged and debilitated people, is often prevented
by the mouths of the vessels being
half closed by the accumulation of viscid
mucus, &amp;c.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Aperient Medicine</span> does enough, if it
increases the customary Evacuation,&mdash;and
does too much,&mdash;if it does more,&mdash;than
excite one additional motion.</p>

<p>Bowels which are forced into double action<span class="pagenum" title="220"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220"></a></span>
to-day&mdash;must, consequently, be costive to-morrow,
and Constipation will be caused
by the remedy you have recourse to to
remove it,&mdash;this has given rise to a <i>Vulgar
Error</i>,&mdash;that the use of even the mildest
Laxative is followed by Costiveness.</p>

<p><i>Rhubarb</i> is particularly under this prejudice,&mdash;because
it has been more frequently
employed as a domestic remedy,&mdash;and
unadvisedly administered in either too
little, or too large a Dose. It has, however,
been recommended by a Physician of acknowledged
Ability, and extensive Experience.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If the Bowels are constipated, they
should be kept regular by a Pill of Rhubarb
of five grains every morning.&rdquo;&mdash;<span class="smcap">Pemberton</span>
<i>on the Abdominal Viscera</i>, p. <a href='#Page_113'>113</a>.</p>

<p>People are often needlessly uneasy about
the Action of their Bowels.&mdash;If their general
Health is good, and they have neither Head-ach
nor other deranged sensations, and they
live temperately, during the second period
of Life, whether they have two motions
in one day, or one in two days, perhaps is<span class="pagenum" title="221"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221"></a></span>
not of much consequence;&mdash;however, that
the Alvine Exoneration should take place
regularly is certainly most desirable;&mdash;especially
after <i>Thirty-Five</i> years of age<a name="FNanchor_99_99" id="FNanchor_99_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_99_99" class="fnanchor">99</a>,
when the elasticity of the machinery of Life
begins to diminish.</p>

<p><i>To acquire a Habit of Regularity</i>, Mr.
<span class="smcap">Locke</span>, who was a Physician as well as a Philosopher,
advises that &ldquo;if any person, as soon
as he has breakfasted, would presently solicit
nature, so as to obtain a stool, he might in
time, by a constant application, bring it to be
habitual.&rdquo; He says &ldquo;I have known none who
have been steady in the prosecution of this
plan, who did not in a few months obtain the
desired success.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>On Education</i>, p. 23, &amp;c.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is well known that the alvine evacuation
is periodical, and subjected to the<span class="pagenum" title="222"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222"></a></span>
power of habit; if the regular call is not
obeyed, the necessity for the evacuation
passes away; and the call being again and
again neglected, habitual costiveness is the
consequence.&rdquo;&mdash;<span class="smcap">Hamilton</span> <i>on Purgatives</i>,
p. 72.</p>

<p>It will facilitate the acquirement of this
salutary evacuation,&mdash;to take at night&mdash;such
a dose of an Aperient medicine, as
Experience has pointed out, as just sufficient
to assist nature to produce a Motion
in the Morning.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Habitual Costiveness</span> is not curable
by Drugs alone,&mdash;and is most agreeably
corrected by <i>Diet and Regimen</i>, those most
important, and only effectual, although much
neglected (because little understood) means
of permanently alleviating <i>Chronic Complaints</i>,
for which</p>

<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Coquina est optima Medicina.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>

<p>Strong Constitutions are generally <i>Costive</i><a name="FNanchor_100_100" id="FNanchor_100_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_100_100" class="fnanchor">100</a>,&mdash;that
<span class="pagenum" title="223"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223"></a></span>
perfect and vigorous action of the
absorbents, which is the cause of their
strength, is also the cause of their Constipation:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Oportet sanorum, sedes esse figuratas.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>

<p>This ought to make them content,&mdash;but
the Constipated are for ever murmuring
about a habit&mdash;which, if managed with
moderate care,&mdash;is the fundamental basis
of Health and Long Life. A little attention
to Regimen will generally prevent it&mdash;a
simple Laxative will suffice to remove it&mdash;and
neither will be often necessary, for those
who observe a deobstruent Diet&mdash;take
proper Exercise in a pure Air&mdash;sufficient
liquid Food&mdash;and eat freely of Butter, Salt,
and Sugar.</p>

<p>The peculiarity of most Constitutions is
so convenient, that almost all Costive persons&mdash;by
attending to the effects which
various things produce upon their Bowels&mdash;may
find, in their usual Food and Drink,<span class="pagenum" title="224"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224"></a></span>
the means of persuading their sluggish
Viscera to vibrate with healthful celerity.</p>

<p>A <span class="smcap">Supper</span> or <span class="smcap">Breakfast</span> of thin Gruel,
(No. 572,) with plenty of Butter and Salt in it,&mdash;ripe
Fruits, particularly <i>Grapes</i><a name="FNanchor_101_101" id="FNanchor_101_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_101_101" class="fnanchor">101</a>,&mdash;Oranges,&mdash;Strawberries,&mdash;Raspberries,&mdash;Mulberries,&mdash;Marmalade,&mdash;Honey,&mdash;Treacle,&mdash;roasted
Apples,&mdash;stewed Prunes,&mdash;Figs,&mdash;Raisins,&mdash;Tamarinds,&mdash;French
Plumbs, &amp;c.;&mdash;will
almost always produce the desired effect.</p>

<p>Two or three strong <i>Cinnamon or Ginger
Lozenges</i>, (see <a href='#Page_234'>page 234</a>,) gradually dissolved
in the mouth when the Stomach is empty,
will act as an Aperient on many persons.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="225"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225"></a></span>
<span class="smcap">Salad Oil</span> is a very pleasant <i>Peristaltic
Persuader</i>:&mdash;by the following means it may
be introduced (as a supper) to the most
delicate Stomach,&mdash;without any offence to
the most fastidious Palate.</p>

<p>Put a table-spoonful of Sherry into a wine-glass&mdash;on
this a table-spoonful of Olive Oil&mdash;on
this another table-spoonful of Sherry&mdash;or
rub together a table-spoonful or two of
Oil, with the yolk of an Egg boiled hard,
(No. 547,) add a little Vinegar and Salt to
it, and eat it at Supper as a Sauce to a
Salad (No. 138*) of Mustard and Cresses,&mdash;or
Lettuce,&mdash;Radishes,&mdash;Button Onions,&mdash;Celery,&mdash;Cucumber,
&amp;c.;&mdash;or cold boiled
Asparagus,&mdash;Brocoli,&mdash;Cauliflower,&mdash;Carrot,&mdash;or
Turnip,&mdash;Kidney or French Beans,&mdash;or
Pease;&mdash;or Pickled Salmon, (No. 161,)
Lobster, (No. 176,) Shrimps, Herrings, Sprats,
(No. 170**,) or Mackarel, (No. 168,) or as
a Sauce to cold Meat, &amp;c.</p>

<p>You may give it an infinite variety of
agreeable flavours; the ingredients to pro<span class="pagenum" title="226"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226"></a></span>duce
which are enumerated in (No. 372) of
&ldquo;<span class="smcap">the Cook&rsquo;s Oracle</span>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Hypochondriac people are fond of taking
Medicine at certain times, the spring and
fall,&mdash;at the full or the new Moon, &amp;c.
whether they want it or not.&mdash;For those in
Health to attempt to improve it by taking
Physic, is absurd indeed. Remember the
epitaph on the Italian Count&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
<p><span style="margin-left: 2em;">&ldquo;I was well&mdash;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Wished to be better&mdash;</span><br />
Took Physic&mdash;and died.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Hypochondriasis&mdash;Spleen&mdash;Vapours&mdash;the
Blue Devils&mdash;the Bile&mdash;Nervous Debility,
&amp;c. are but so many different names
for those Disorders which arise either from
<span class="smcap">Chronic Weakness</span> of the Constitution&mdash;or
an inconsiderate management of it.&mdash;A
man who has a strong stamina will bear
irregularities with impunity&mdash;which will soon
destroy a more delicate frame.</p>

<p>We do not laugh at the melancholy of
the Hypochondriac,&mdash;or consider his Com<span class="pagenum" title="227"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227"></a></span>plaints
as merely the hallucinations of <i>un
Malade Imaginaire</i>; but trace the cause of
them to either some Indigestion interrupting
the functions of the Alimentary Canal&mdash;which
a gentle Aperient would immediately
remove&mdash;or the ineffective performance of
the Restorative Process&mdash;insufficiently nutritive
Diet&mdash;or depression of the vital and
animal functions from anxiety or over-exertion
of either the Mind or the Body:&mdash;which
nothing but Rest and nutritive Food
can repair.</p>

<p>The Editor of this little treatise has had
from his Youth to bear up against an highly
irritable nervous system,&mdash;the means he has
found useful to manage and support it, he is
now recording for the benefit of other Nervous
Invalids.</p>

<hr class="c20" />

<p>We advise our Friends&mdash;never to call in
even the gentle aid of Peristaltic Persuaders,&mdash;but
when Instinct absolutely insists upon<span class="pagenum" title="228"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228"></a></span>
it&mdash;some of the Indications of which are,
&ldquo;A disagreeable taste in the Mouth&mdash;Eructations&mdash;Want
of Appetite&mdash;Sensations
of distention in the Stomach and
Bowels&mdash;Pains in the Stomach or Head&mdash;Vertigo&mdash;Feverishness&mdash;Restlessness&mdash;Peevishness,&rdquo;
&amp;c.&mdash;but these will often disappear
by taking a liquid meal, instead
of a solid one, or using more exercise,
will often answer the purpose.&mdash;Mr. Jones
very sensibly observes, &ldquo;if people will by
no means rest from constantly tampering
with laxatives, instead of using exercise, the
habit of using the <i>Lavement</i> every evening
cannot be so destructive, as it irritates only
<i>twelve inches</i> of intestine, and spares raking
down the other <i>thirty-nine feet</i>.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>See Med.
Vul. Errors</i>, p. 44.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Relaxed Bowels</span><a name="FNanchor_102_102" id="FNanchor_102_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_102_102" class="fnanchor">102</a> are often extremely
<span class="pagenum" title="229"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229"></a></span>
unmanageable, and difficult to regulate&mdash;and
are the principal cause of that <i>Chronic
Weakness</i> which is so generally complained
of, and of many other distressing Nervous
Disorders.</p>

<p>If the Bowels are unfaithful to the Stomach,
and, instead of playing fair,&mdash;let go
their hold of the &ldquo;Pabulum Vit√¶,&rdquo; before
the Absorbents have properly performed the
process which that grand organ has prepared
for them&mdash;Nutrition will be deficient; and
Flatulence, &amp;c. &amp;c. Giddiness,&mdash;Spasms,&mdash;Head-ache,&mdash;and
Back-ache,&mdash;and what
are called <i>Bilious and Nervous</i> Disorders,&mdash;and
all the Diseases incident to Debility,
will attack you on the slightest cause.</p>

<p>Those who are afflicted with a relaxation
of the Bowels, are advised to a <i>Dry diet</i>,<span class="pagenum" title="230"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230"></a></span>
rather than a <i>Liquid one</i>, and must submit to
a Regimen diametrically contrary to that we
have recommended to cure Constipation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Since I lessened my Drink I have been
much more costive than I was before, and
have for two years past freed myself from a
Diarrh&#339;a. Costiveness generally attends
dry food in other animals as well as men.&rdquo;&mdash;B.
<span class="smcap">Robinson</span>, <i>on Food and Discharges</i>,
p. 82 and 64.</p>

<p>Live principally upon Animal Food sufficiently
cooked, and Stale Bread, or biscuit;&mdash;instead
of Malt liquor (unless it be very
mild and good Homebrewed Beer, which
is the best of all Beverages) drink Beef-Tea,
(No. 563), or well made Toast and
Water<a name="FNanchor_103_103" id="FNanchor_103_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_103_103" class="fnanchor">103</a> (No. 463*), with about one-fourth
<span class="pagenum" title="231"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231"></a></span>
part of Wine, and a little Sugar and grated
Nutmeg or Ginger in it;&mdash;if the Stomach
be troubled with Acidity, or great Flatulence,
one-eighth part of Brandy may agree with it
better:&mdash;<i>whatever You eat and drink should
be Warmed</i>.&mdash;See <a href='#Page_94'>page 94</a> on <i>Siesta</i>, and
<a href='#Page_158'>page 158</a>.</p>

<p>Be watchful of the effects of the Food
which you take,&mdash;avoid whatever appears
to irritate, and <i>eat only that which experience
has proved acceptable</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Irritable Bowels</span> are excited to inconveniently
increased action by any thing that
the Stomach has either not the ability, or
the inclination, to prepare for them,&mdash;and
<i>Diarrh&#339;a</i> is the consequence.</p>

<p>The easiest and most effectual method of<span class="pagenum" title="232"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232"></a></span>
restoring tranquillity in the Bowels&mdash;is to
be content with a light diet of Gruel, Broth,
or Fish, &amp;c. till the return of a keen Appetite
assures you, that the Stomach has recovered
its powers, and being ready for action, requires
its usual supply of solid food.</p>

<p><i>When the Bowels get a trick of emptying
themselves too often</i>,&mdash;a teaspoonful of
Compound Powder of Chalk in your Tea,&mdash;or
a wine-glassful of the following mixture,
taken twice or thrice a day, will generally
cure them of it very speedily:&mdash;</p>

<p style="margin-left: 2em">
&#8478; Chalk mixture, six ounces.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Tincture of Cinnamon (No. 416*), one ditto.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Opiate Confection, one drachm.</span><br />
Mixed together.</p>

<p>If Diarrh&#339;a continues obstinate, more
powerful Astringents<a name="FNanchor_104_104" id="FNanchor_104_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_104_104" class="fnanchor">104</a> may be necessary.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="233"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233"></a></span>
<span class="smcap">Tincture of Cinnamon</span> (No. 416*) is
one of the best cordial tonics&mdash;see also
(No. 569) and (Nos. 413 &amp; 15.)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Opium Lozenges</span>, containing a quarter
of a grain each, and strongly flavoured with
Oil of Peppermint, are recommended to those
who are troubled with relaxed Bowels.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Strong Peppermint Lozenges</span> are
the most convenient portable carminative:&mdash;as
soon as they are dissolved, their influence
is felt from the beginning, to the end
of the Alimentary Canal;&mdash;they dissipate
flatulence so immediately, that they well
deserve the name of <i>Vegetable √Üther</i>; and
are recommended to <span class="smcap">Singers<a name="FNanchor_105_105" id="FNanchor_105_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_105_105" class="fnanchor">105</a> and Public
Speakers</span>, as giving effective excitement
<span class="pagenum" title="234"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234"></a></span>
to the organs of the Voice,&mdash;as a support
against the distressing effects of fasting too
long&mdash;and to give energy to the Stomach
between meals.</p>

<p>N.B. <i>Sixty different sorts of Lozenges</i>, are
made in the most superlative manner, by
Mr. Smith, Fell Street, Wood Street, Cheapside.</p>

<p>His <i>Rose Jujubes</i>&mdash;are a very elegant
preparation, which those who have not a remarkably
Sweet Breath, are recommended to
take the last thing at night, and the first in
the morning&mdash;the breath smells faintest
when the Stomach is emptiest.</p>

<p>His <i>Mellifluous Aromatics</i> are so delicately
flavoured, they moisten the mouth and throat
without cloying the Palate, Stomach, &amp;c.,
which is more than can be said of most
Lozenges.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="235"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235"></a></span>
<i>To make</i> <span class="smcap">Forty Peristaltic Persuaders</span>.</p>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Syrup (by weight) one drachm.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Oil of Carraway, ten drops (minums).</span><br />
Made into Pills, each of which will contain <i>Three Grains of Rhubarb</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Dose of the Persuaders</span> must
be adapted to the constitutional peculiarity
of the Patient:&mdash;when you wish to accelerate
or augment the Alvine Exoneration&mdash;take
two, three, or more, according to the effect
you desire to produce&mdash;<i>two Pills</i> will do as
much for one person as <i>five</i> or <i>six</i> will for
another; they generally will very regularly
perform what you wish to-day,&mdash;without
interfering with what you hope will happen
to-morrow;&mdash;and are, therefore, as convenient
an argument against Constipation as
any we are acquainted with.</p>

<p><i>The most convenient opportunity to introduce
them to the Stomach</i>&mdash;is early in the Morning,<span class="pagenum" title="236"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236"></a></span>
when it is unoccupied,&mdash;and has no particular
business to attend to, <i>i. e.</i> at least half
an hour before Breakfast.</p>

<p><i>Physic</i> should never interrupt the Stomach,
when it is engaged in digesting <i>Food</i>&mdash;perhaps
the best time to take it, is when you
awake out of your first Sleep&mdash;or as soon as
you awake in the morning. Moreover, such
is the increased sensibility of some Stomachs
at that time, that half the quantity of Medicine
will suffice.</p>

<p>From <i>two to four Persuaders</i> will generally
produce one additional motion within twelve
hours.</p>

<p>They may be taken at any time&mdash;by the
most <span class="smcap">delicate Females</span>, whose Constitutions
are so often distressed by Constipation<a name="FNanchor_106_106" id="FNanchor_106_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_106_106" class="fnanchor">106</a>,
and destroyed by the drastic purgatives
they take to relieve it. See also <a href='#Page_224'>page 224</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="237"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237"></a></span>
Their agreeable flavour recommends them
as the most convenient aperient for <span class="smcap">Children</span>,
whose indispositions most frequently
arise from obstructions in the Bowels;&mdash;it
is not always a very easy task to prevail upon
a spoiled Child to take Physic;&mdash;therefore&mdash;we
have made our Pill to taste exactly like
Gingerbread.</p>

<p>For <span class="smcap">Infants</span>, too young to swallow a
Pill, pound it, and mix it with Currant Jelly,

it is the only remedy for one Disease,
people suppose must be a <i>panacea</i> for every

which are awfully uncertain both in their

<p>If, instead of two or three times a week

the Alimentary tube&mdash;and speedily and
effectually cure the disorder, without injuring
the Constitution.</p>

<p>There is not a more universal or more mischievous
<i>Vulgar Error</i>, than the notion, that
Physic is efficacious, in proportion as it is extremely
disagreeable to take, and frightfully
violent in its operation,&mdash;unless a medicine
actually produces more Distress in the System,
than the Disorder it is administered to
remove&mdash;in fact, if the Remedy be not
worse than the Disease, the million have
no faith in it&mdash;and are not satisfied that
they can be perfectly cured if they escape
Phlebotomy,&mdash;unless put to extreme pain,

of that Doctor who most furiously</p>

<blockquote><p>&ldquo;<i>Vomits</i>&mdash;<i>Purges</i>&mdash;<i>Blisters</i>&mdash;<i>Bleeds</i>, and <i>Sweats &rsquo;em</i>.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>

<p>To perfectly content them that you have most
profoundly considered their case, you must<span class="pagenum" title="242"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242"></a></span>
to such Prescription&mdash;add a Proscription of
every thing they appear particularly partial
to!!!</p>

<p>People who in all other respects appear to
be very rational&mdash;and are apt to try other
questions by the rules of Common Sense, in
matters relating to their Health, surrender
their understanding to the fashion of the
Day,&mdash;and in the present Century, on all

Brandy, or Proof Spirit, one pint.</p>

<p>Let these ingredients steep for ten days,

<p>Dose&mdash;one teaspoonful in a wineglass of
water, twice a day, when you feel languid,<span class="pagenum" title="243"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243"></a></span>
<i>i. e.</i> when the Stomach is empty, about an
hour before Dinner, and in the Evening.
Twenty grains of the Powder of Bark may
be added to it occasionally.</p>

<p>To this agreeable Aromatic Tonic we are
under personal obligations, for frequently
putting our Stomach into good temper, and
procuring us good Appetite and good Digestion.</p>

<p>In low Nervous affections, arising from a
languid Circulation&mdash;and, when the Stomach
is in a state of shabby debility from age&mdash;intemperance,
or other causes&mdash;this is a most
acceptable restorative.</p>

<p>N.B. <span class="smcap">Tea</span> made with dried and bruised
<i>Seville Orange Peel</i>, (in the same manner as
common Tea,) and drank with milk and

<p>Two ounces of <span class="smcap">Cascarilla</span> Bark (bruised)&mdash;or
dried <span class="smcap">Orange Peel</span>,&mdash;or <span class="smcap">Colomba
Root</span>&mdash;infused for a fortnight in a pint of

<p style="margin-left: 4em"><span class="smcap">Tincture of Cinnamon</span>, (No. 416*).</p>

<p>This excellent Cordial is made by pouring
a bottle of genuine Cogniac (No. 471) on
three ounces of bruised Cinnamon (Cassia
will not do). This cordial restorative was
more in vogue formerly, than it is now;&mdash;a
teaspoonful of it, and a lump of Sugar, in
a glass of good Sherry or Madeira, with the
yolk of an Egg beat up in it&mdash;was called
&ldquo;<i>Balsamum Vit√¶</i>.&rdquo;</p>

<p><i>Obs.</i>&mdash;Two teaspoonsful in a wineglass

<p style="margin-left: 4em"><span class="smcap">Soda Water</span>, (No. 481*.)</p>

<p>The best way of producing agreeable
<i>Pneumatic Punch</i>, as a learned Chemist has
called this refreshing refrigerant, is to fill two
half-pint Tumblers half full of Water,&mdash;stir
into one 30 grains of <i>Carbonate of Potash</i>,&mdash;into
the other 25 grains of <i>Citric<a name="FNanchor_111_111" id="FNanchor_111_111"></a><a href="#Footnote_111_111" class="fnanchor">111</a> Acid</i>,
<span class="pagenum" title="246"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246"></a></span>
(both being previously finely pounded,)&mdash;when
the powders are perfectly dissolved&mdash;pour
the contents of one tumbler into the
other&mdash;and sparkling Soda Water is instantaneously
produced.</p>

<p>To make <span class="smcap">Double Soda Water</span>, use
double the quantity of the Powder.</p>

<p><i>Single Soda Water</i> is a delightful drink in
sultry weather&mdash;and may be very agreeably
flavoured by dissolving a little Raspberry or
Red Currant Jelly in the Water, (before you
add the Carbonate of Potash to it), or a little
Tincture of Ginger, (No. 411,)&mdash;or Syrup of
Ginger, (No. 394,)&mdash;or Syrup of Lemon
Peel, (No. 393,)&mdash;or infuse a roll of fresh
and thin-cut Lemon Peel, and a bit of Sugar
in the water&mdash;or rub down a few drops of
(No. 408,) with a bit of Lump Sugar, with
or without a little grated Ginger;&mdash;a glass
of Sherry or a tablespoonful of Brandy is
sometimes added.</p>

<p>The addition of a teaspoonful of the <span class="smcap">Tonic
Tincture</span> (No. 569,) will give you a very<span class="pagenum" title="247"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247"></a></span>
refreshing Stomachic&mdash;and ten drops of
<i>Tinct. Ferri Muriati</i> put into the water in
which you dissolve the Citric Acid&mdash;a fine
effervescing Chalybeate.</p>

<p><i>The day after a Feast</i>, if you feel fevered
and heated, you cannot do better than drink
a half-pint glass or two of <i>Single Soda
Water</i> between Breakfast and Dinner.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Double Soda Water</span> (especially if
made with tepid water) is an excellent
auxiliary to accelerate the operation of
Aperient Medicine&mdash;and, if taken in the
Morning fasting, will sometimes move the
Bowels without further assistance.</p>

<p>If some good <i>Cogniac</i> or Essence of
Ginger (No. 411) be added to it, it is one of
the best helps to set the Stomach to work&mdash;and
remove the distressing languor which
sometimes follows hard drinking.</p>

<hr class="c20" />

<p style="margin-left: 4em"><span class="smcap">Essence of Ginger</span>, (No. 411).</p>

<p>The fragrant <i>aroma</i> of Ginger is so extremely
volatile, that it evaporates almost as<span class="pagenum" title="248"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248"></a></span>
soon as it is pounded&mdash;the fine Lemon peel
<i>go√ªt</i> flies off presently.</p>

<p>If Ginger is taken to produce an immediate
effect&mdash;to warm the Stomach&mdash;dispel
Flatulence, &amp;c., or as an addition to Aperient
Medicine&mdash;the following is the best preparation
of it:&mdash;</p>

<p>Steep three ounces of <i>fresh grated</i> Ginger,

thin) in a quart of Brandy&mdash;or Proof Spirit,
for ten days, shaking it up each day.</p>

<p>N.B. <span class="smcap">Tincture of Allspice</span>, which
is sometimes called <i>Essence of Bishop</i>, for
making <i>Mulled Wine</i>, <i>&amp;c.</i> extempore, is prepared
in the same manner.</p>

<hr class="c20" />

<p style="margin-left: 4em"><span class="smcap">Gruel</span>, (No. 252).</p>

<p>1st. Ask those who are to eat it, if they
like it <i>THICK</i> or <i>thin</i>; if the latter, mix well
together by degrees, in a pint basin, <i>one</i>
tablespoonful of Oatmeal with three of cold
water;&mdash;if the former, <i>two</i> spoonsful.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="249"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249"></a></span>
Have ready, in a Stewpan, a pint of boiling
water or milk&mdash;pour this by degrees to
the Oatmeal you have mixed&mdash;return it into
the Stewpan&mdash;set it on the fire&mdash;and let it
boil for five minutes&mdash;stirring it all the time
to prevent the Oatmeal from burning at the
bottom of the Stewpan&mdash;skim&mdash;and strain
it through a Hair Sieve.</p>

<p>2d. To convert this into <span class="smcap">Caudle</span>&mdash;add
a little Ale&mdash;Wine&mdash;or Brandy&mdash;with
Sugar&mdash;and <i>if the Bowels are disordered</i>, a
little Nutmeg or Ginger grated.</p>

or (No. 252,) or (No. 564,) instead of Water&mdash;(to
make <i>Crowdie</i>, see No. 205*,)&mdash;and may
<span class="pagenum" title="251"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251"></a></span>
be flavoured with <i>Sweet Herbs</i>&mdash;<i>Soup Roots</i>
and <i>Savoury Spices</i>&mdash;by boiling them for a
<span class="pagenum" title="252"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252"></a></span>

make the Gruel with&mdash;or <span class="smcap">Zest</span> (No. 255)&mdash;Pea

<p><span class="smcap">Plain Gruel</span>, such as is directed in the
first part of this Recipe, is one of the best
Breakfasts and Suppers that we can recommend
to the rational Epicure;&mdash;is the most
comforting soother of an irritable Stomach
that we know&mdash;and particularly acceptable
to it <i>after a hard day&rsquo;s work of Intemperate
Feasting</i>&mdash;when the addition of half an
ounce of Butter, and a teaspoonful of Epsom
Salt will give it an aperient quality, which
will assist the principal Viscera to get rid of
their burden.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>Water Gruel</i>&rdquo; (says Tryon in his Obs.
on Health, 16mo. 1688, p. 42,) is &ldquo;the
<span class="smcap">King</span> <i>of Spoon Meats</i>,&rdquo; and &ldquo;the <span class="smcap">Queen</span>
<i>of Soups</i>,&rdquo; and gratifies nature beyond all
others.</p>

<p>In the &ldquo;<i>Art of Thriving</i>,&rdquo; 1697, p. 8, are
directions for preparing Fourscore Noble and
Wholesome Dishes, upon most of which <i>a
Man may live excellent well for Twopence a</i><span class="pagenum" title="256"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256"></a></span>
<i>day</i>: the author&rsquo;s <i>Obs.</i> on <i>Water Gruel</i> is,
that &ldquo;<span class="smcap">Essence of Oatmeal</span>&rdquo; makes &ldquo;<i>a
noble and exhilarating meal</i>!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Franklin&rsquo;s</span> favourite Breakfast was
a good basin of warm Gruel, in which there
was a small slice of Butter with Toasted
Bread and Nutmeg&mdash;the expense of this,
he reckoned at three half-pence.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mastication is a very necessary Preparation
of solid Aliment, without which there
can be no good Digestion.&rdquo;&mdash;The above are
the first lines in <span class="smcap">Arbuthnot&rsquo;s</span> <i>Essay on
Aliment</i>.</p>

<p>This first act of the important process of
Digestion, is most perfectly performed, when
the flavour, &amp;c. of our Food is agreeable to
our Taste;&mdash;we naturally detain upon our
Palate those things which please it,&mdash;and
the Meat we relish most, is consequently
most broken down by chewing, and most
intimately incorporated with the Saliva&mdash;this
is the reason why what we desire most,
we digest best.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="257"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257"></a></span>
Here, is a sufficient answer, to the Folios
which have sprung from the Pens of cynical
and senseless Scribblers&mdash;on whom Nature
not having bestowed a Palate, they have
proscribed those pleasures they had not
Sense<a name="FNanchor_113_113" id="FNanchor_113_113"></a><a href="#Footnote_113_113" class="fnanchor">113</a> to taste, or comprehend the wise
purposes for which they were given to us,
and</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;Compound for Sins they are inclin&rsquo;d to,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By damning those they have no mind to.&rdquo;</span>
</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="258"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258"></a></span>
How large a share of the business of
Digestion is managed by Mastication, has
been shown by the experiments of <i>Spallanzani</i><a name="FNanchor_114_114" id="FNanchor_114_114"></a><a href="#Footnote_114_114" class="fnanchor">114</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="259"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259"></a></span>
To Chew long, and leisurely, is the only
way to extract the essence of our food&mdash;to
enjoy the taste of it, and to render it easily
convertible into laudable Chyle, by the facility
it gives to the gastric juices to dissolve it
without trouble.</p>

<p>The pleasure of the <i>Palate</i>, and the health
of the <i>Stomach</i>, are equally promoted by this
salutary habit, which all should be taught to
acquire in their infancy.</p>

<p>The more tender meat is, the more we may
eat of it.&mdash;That which is most difficult to
Chew, is of course most difficult to Digest.</p>

<p>From 30 to 40 (according to the tenderness
of the meat) has been calculated as the
mean number of Munches, that solid meat
requires, to prepare it for its journey down<span class="pagenum" title="260"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260"></a></span>
<i>the Red Lane</i>; less will be sufficient for
tender, delicate, and easily digestible white
meats.</p>

<p>The sagacious <i>Gourmand</i>, will calculate
this precisely,&mdash;and not waste his precious
moments in useless Jaw-work, or invite an
Indigestion by neglecting <i>Mastication</i>.</p>

<p>I cannot give any positive rules for this, it
depends on the state of the Teeth<a name="FNanchor_115_115" id="FNanchor_115_115"></a><a href="#Footnote_115_115" class="fnanchor">115</a>; every
one, especially <i>the Dyspeptic</i>, ought to ascertain
the condition of these useful working
tools; and to use them with proportionate
diligence, is an indispensable exercise which
every rational Epicure will most cheerfully
perform, who has any regard for the welfare
of his Stomach<a name="FNanchor_116_116" id="FNanchor_116_116"></a><a href="#Footnote_116_116" class="fnanchor">116</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="261"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261"></a></span>
It has been recommended, that those whose
Teeth are defective, should mince their meat&mdash;this
will certainly save trouble to both
Teeth and Stomach&mdash;nevertheless, it is advisable,
let the meat be minced ever so fine,
to endeavour to mumble it into a pulp before
it be introduced to the Stomach&mdash;on account
of the advantage derived from its admixture
with the <span class="smcap">Saliva</span>.</p>

<p>&ldquo;By experiment, I determined the quantity
of <i>Saliva</i> secreted in half an hour, to be
<i>whilst the parts were at rest</i>, four drachms,&mdash;whilst
<i>eating</i>, five ounces four drachms.&rdquo;&mdash;<span class="smcap">Stark</span>
<i>on Diet</i>, p. 99.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mastication</span> is the source of all good
Digestion;&mdash;<i>with its assistance</i>, almost any
thing may be put into any stomach with impunity:&mdash;<i>without
it</i>, Digestion is always
difficult, and often impossible: and be it<span class="pagenum" title="262"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262"></a></span>
always remembered, it is not merely what we
eat, but what we digest well, that nourishes
us.</p>

<p>The sagacious <i>Gourmand</i> is ever mindful
of his motto&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Masticate, Denticate, Chump, Grind, and Swallow.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>

<p>The four first acts, he knows he must perform
properly,&mdash;before he dare attempt the
fifth.</p>

<p>Those who cannot enjoy a savoury morsel
on account of their Teeth, or rather on account
of the want of them, we refer to the
note at the foot of <a href="#Footnote_115_115">p. 260</a>, and also have the
pleasure to inform them, that <span class="smcap">Patent Masticators</span>
are made by <span class="smcap">Palmer</span>, <i>Cutler, in
St. James&rsquo;s Street</i>.</p>

<p>To those who may inadvertently exercise
their Masticative faculties on unworthy materials&mdash;or
longer on worthy ones than nature
finds convenient, we recommend &ldquo;Peristaltic
Persuaders.&rdquo; See <a href='#Page_235'>page 235</a>.</p>

<p>When either the <i>Teeth</i> or <i>Stomach</i> are ex<span class="pagenum" title="263"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263"></a></span>tremely feeble, especial care
must be taken <i>to keep Meat till it is tender</i>&mdash;before it is
cooked&mdash;and call in the aid of the <i>Pestle</i> and <i>Mortar</i>.&mdash;And
see Nos. 10,&mdash;18,&mdash;87,&mdash;89,&mdash;175,&mdash;178; from
185 to 250,&mdash;502&mdash;542&mdash;and especially 503. Or dress in
the usual way whatever is best liked&mdash;mince it&mdash;put it into a
Mortar&mdash;and pound it with a little Broth or melted
Butter,&mdash;Vegetable,&mdash;Herb,&mdash;Spice,&mdash;Zest, No. 255,
&amp;c.&mdash;according to the taste, &amp;c. of the Eater.&mdash;The
business of the Stomach is thus very materially facilitated.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mincing or Pounding Meat&mdash;saveth
the grinding of the Teeth; and therefore
(no doubt) is more nourishing, especially in
Age,&mdash;or to them that have weak teeth;
but Butter is not proper for weak bodies,&mdash;and
therefore, moisten it in pounding with
a little Claret Wine, and a very little Cinnamon
or Nutmeg.&rdquo;&mdash;<span class="smcap">Lord Bacon&rsquo;s</span> <i>Natural
History</i>, Century 1.&mdash;54.</p>

<p>This is important Advice for those who<span class="pagenum" title="264"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264"></a></span>
are afflicted with &ldquo;<i>Tic Douloureux</i>,&rdquo;&mdash;the
paroxysm of which is generally provoked by
the exercise of Eating,&mdash;and the Editor has
known that dreadful disorder cured by the
Patient frequently taking food thus prepared
in small portions, instead of a regular meal.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Teeth</span> should be cleaned after every
meal with a &ldquo;<span class="smcap">Tooth Preserver</span>,&rdquo; (<i>i. e.</i> a
very soft brush,) and then rinsed with <i>tepid</i>
water&mdash;<i>never neglect this at night</i>;&mdash;nothing
destroys the Teeth so fast as suffering food
to stick between them&mdash;those who observe
this rule, will seldom have any occasion for
<i>Dentifrices</i>&mdash;<i>Essences of Ivory</i>&mdash;<i>Indurating
Liquid Enamels</i>, <i>&amp;c.</i></p>

<p>But it is the rage just now with some
Dentists, to recommend Brushes so hard,
that they fetch Blood like a Lancet wherever
they touch; and instead of &ldquo;<i>Teeth Preservers</i>,&rdquo;
these should rather be termed &ldquo;<i>Gum
Bleeders</i>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Not even a Philosopher can endure the
<span class="smcap">Toothach</span> patiently&mdash;what an overcoming
<span class="pagenum" title="265"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265"></a></span>
agony then it must be to a <i>Grand Gourmand</i>!&mdash;depriving
him of the means of enjoying an
amusement which to him is the grand solace
for all sublunary cares.&mdash;To alleviate, and indeed
generally to cure this intolerable pain&mdash;we
recommend</p>

<p><i>Toothache and Anti-rheumatic Embrocation</i>, (No. 567.)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 2em">
Sal Volatile&mdash;three parts.<br />
Laudanum&mdash;one part.</p>

<p>Mix and rub the part in pain therewith frequently.
If the Tooth which aches is hollow,
drop some of this on a bit of cotton, and put
it into the Tooth,&mdash;if the pain does not
abate within an hour&mdash;take out the cotton,
and put another piece in&mdash;changing it every
hour four or five times, till the pain ceases.</p>

<p>In a general Face-ach, or sore Throat&mdash;moisten
a piece of flannel with it and put
it to the part affected,&mdash;rub any part
afflicted with Rheumatism night and morning,<span class="pagenum" title="266"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266"></a></span>
and in the middle of the day. I have frequently
cured old and inveterate Rheumatic
affections with this Liniment.</p>

confined to pedestrians and pugilists alone&mdash;they extend
to every man; and were training generally introduced
instead of medicines, as an expedient for the
prevention and cure of diseases, its beneficial consequences
would promote his happiness and prolong his
life. &ldquo;Our Health, Vigour, and Activity, must
depend upon regimen and exercise; or, in other words,
upon the observance of those rules which constitute
the theory of the training process.&rdquo;&mdash;<span class="smcap">Capt. Barclay</span>
<i>on Training</i>, p. 239.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It has been made a question, whether Training produces
a <i>lasting</i>, or only a <i>temporary</i> effect on the constitution?
It is undeniable, that if a man be brought to
a better condition; if corpulency, and the impurities
of his body disappear; and if his wind and strength be
improved by any process whatever, his good state of
health will continue, until some derangement of his
frame shall take place from accidental or natural
causes. If he shall relapse into intemperance, or
neglect the means of preserving his health, either by
omitting to take the necessary exercise, or by indulging
in debilitating propensities, he must expect such encroachments
to be made on his constitution, as must
soon unhinge his system. But if he shall observe a
different plan&mdash;the beneficial effects of the training
process will remain until the gradual decay of his
natural functions shall, in mature old age, intimate the
approach of his dissolution.&rdquo;&mdash;<span class="smcap">Capt. Barclay</span> <i>on

in his most extraordinary walk of 1000 miles in
1000 successive hours, June 1, 1809. &ldquo;He <i>Breakfasted</i>
after returning from his walk, at five in the morning.
He ate a roasted Fowl, and drank a pint of strong
Ale, and then took two cups of Tea with Bread and
Butter.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He <i>Lunched</i> at twelve; the one day on Beef Steaks,
and the other on Mutton Chops, of which he ate a
considerable quantity.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He <i>Dined</i> at six, either on Roast Beef, or Mutton
Chops. His drink was Porter, and two or three glasses
of wine.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He <i>Supped</i> at eleven, on a cold fowl. He ate such
vegetables as were in season; and the quantity of
Animal food he took daily, was from five to six pounds.&rdquo;&mdash;See
<i>Pedestrianism</i>, p. 6.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>His style of Walking is</i> to bend forward the body,
and to throw its weight on the knees. His step is
short, and his feet are raised only a few inches from
the ground. Any person who will try this plan, will
find that his pace will be quickened, at the same time he
will walk with more ease to himself, and be better able
to endure the fatigue of a long journey, than by walking
in a posture perfectly erect, which throws too much of
the weight of the body on the ankle-joints. He always
uses thick-soled shoes, and lamb&rsquo;s wool stockings. It
is a good rule to shift the stockings frequently during
the performance of a long distance; but it is indispensably
requisite to have shoes with thick soles, and so
large, that all unnecessary pressure on the feet may be
avoided.&rdquo;&mdash;p. 208.</p>

advanced in Life, than never to give way to a remission
of Exercise. By degrees the demand for exercise may
shrink, in extreme old age, to little more than a bare
quit-rent; but that quit-rent must be paid, since life is
held by the tenure.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Whoever examines the accounts handed down to
us of the Longest Livers, will generally find, that to the
very last they used some exercise, as walking a certain
distance every day, &amp;c. This is mentioned as something
surprising in them, considering their great age;
whereas the truth is, that their living to such an age,
without some such exercise, would have been the
wonder. Exercise keeps off obstructions, which are
the principal sources of diseases, and ultimately of
death. Motion then is the tenure of life; and old people
who humour or indulge an inclination to sloth and
inactivity, (which is too apt to grow upon them on the
least encouragement), act as unwisely as the poor traveller,
who, bewildered in trackless snow, and surprised
by a chilling frost, instead of resisting the temptation to
sleep, suffers it to steal upon him, though he knows,

mousser le cidre, la bi√®re, l&rsquo;hydromel, et les eaux min√©rales

slimy and viscid meats are longer in digesting in the

of the same animals arrived at their full growth; thus

a want of attention to which too frequently leads to the

state, and Digestion is properly performed, the spirits
are good, and the Body is light and easy; but when
that organ is out of order, a languor, debility, discontent,
melancholy watchfulness, or troublesome dreams,
the nightmare, &amp;c. are the consequences. I have often
been seized with a slight <i>Incubus</i>, attended with a
faintness, as if the circulation was a good deal obstructed,
before I was fully asleep, which has made me
get up suddenly: while I lay awake I felt nothing of
these symptoms, except some degree of uneasiness about
my stomach; but when I was just about to fall asleep,
they began to return again.&rdquo; &ldquo;In this way I have
gone on for two or three hours or more, in the beginning
of the night. At last, I found that a dram of <i>Brandy</i>,
after the first attack, kept me easy the whole night,&rdquo; p. 312.</p>

<p>&ldquo;When affected with uneasy sensation from
wind, I have not only been sensible of a general debility
and flatness of spirits, but the unexpected opening of a
door, or any such trifling unforeseen accident, has instantly
occasioned an odd sensation about my heart,
extending itself to my head and arms, &amp;c. At other
times, when my stomach is in a firmer state, I have no
such feeling: at least, in a very small degree, from
causes which might be thought more apt to produce
them. Fainting, Tremors, Palpitations of the Heart,
convulsive motions, and all those disorders which are
called nervous, &amp;c. &amp;c. are often owing more to the
infirm state of the first passages, than to any fault either
in the Brain or Heart,&rdquo; p. 132, &amp;c.</p>

this end, becomes attentive to his Diet, and observes
the effect which the quantity and quality of his food and
medicines have upon his feelings, and the apparent
powers of his Stomach.</p>

discharged from the Bowels: here, too, the patient,
apprised of the design, notes what kind and dose of
purgative medicine best effect the intention, and whether
it answers better if taken at once, or at intervals.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>3dly</i>, That the secretion of Bile should be right,
both with respect to quantity and quality. In cases
wherein the secretion of Bile has been for a long time
deficient or faulty, I recommend unirritating and undebilitating
doses of Mercury, (<i>i. e.</i> pil. hydrarg.) to be

the Butcher to break the bones of a Leg or a Shin of
Beef, of 10 pounds weight (the fresher killed the
better), put it into a Soup-pot (a <span class="smcap">Digester</span> is the best
utensil for this purpose) that will well hold it; just
cover it with cold water, and set it on the fire to heat
gradually till it nearly boils, (this should be at least an
hour);&mdash;skim it attentively while any scum rises,&mdash;pour
in a little cold water, to throw up the scum that may
remain,&mdash;let it come to a boil again, and again skim it
carefully: when no more scum rises, and the broth appears
clear, (put in neither Roots nor Herbs nor Salt,)
let it boil for eight or ten hours, and then strain it
through a hair sieve into a brown stone pan; set the
Broth where it will cool quickly; put the meat into a
sieve, let it drain, make Potted Beef (No. 503),&mdash;or it
will be very acceptable to many poor families. Next
day remove every particle of <i>Fat</i> from the top of it, and
pour it through a Tammis or fine sieve as quietly as
possible into a Stewpan, taking care not to let any of
the settlings at the bottom of the stone pan go into the
Stewpan, which should be of thick Copper, perfectly
well tinned; add a quarter of an ounce of whole Black
Pepper to it, let it boil briskly, with the stewpan
uncovered, on a quick fire: if any scum rises, take it
off with a skimmer; when it begins to thicken, and is
reduced to about a quart, put it into a smaller stewpan;
set it over a gentler fire, till it is reduced to the
thickness of a very thick Syrup; take care that it does
not burn,&mdash;<i>a moment&rsquo;s inattention now will lose you all
your labour, and the soup will be spoiled</i>:&mdash;take a little
of it out in a spoon and let it cool; if it sets into
strong Jelly, it is done enough;&mdash;if it does not, boil it
a little longer, till it does;&mdash;have ready some little
pots, such as are used for Potted Meats, about an inch
and a half deep, taking care that they are quite dry;&mdash;we
recommend it to be kept in these pots, if it is for
home consumption&mdash;(<i>the less it is reduced, the better
is the flavour of the Soup</i>)&mdash;if it be sufficiently concentrated
to keep for six months;&mdash;if you wish to
preserve it longer, put it into such bladders as are
used for German Sausages,&mdash;or if you prefer it in the
form of Cakes, pour it into a dish about a quarter of
an inch deep; when it is cold, turn it out and weigh
the Cake, and divide it with a paste-cutter into pieces
of half an ounce and an ounce each; place them in a
warm room, and turn them frequently till they are
thoroughly dried;&mdash;this will take a week or ten days;
turn them twice a day;&mdash;when well hardened, if
kept in a dry place, they may be preserved for several
years in any climate.</p>

<p>This extract of Meat makes excellent &ldquo;<i>Tablettes de
Bouillon</i>,&rdquo; for those who are obliged to endure long
fasting.</p>

<p><i>Obs.</i>&mdash;The uses of this concentrated <i>Essence of Meat</i>
are numerous. It is equally economical and convenient
for making <i>extempore</i> Broths, Sauces and Gravies
for Hashed or Stewed Meat, Game, or Poultry, &amp;c.</p>

<p>You may thicken it and flavour it as directed in
(No. 329);&mdash;to make <i>Gravy</i>, Sauces, &amp;c. take double
the quantity ordered for <i>Broth</i>.</p>

<p>If you have time and opportunity, as there is no
seasoning in the Soup, either of Roots, Herbs, or
Spice, boil an Onion with or without a bit of Parsley,
and Sweet Herbs, and a few corns of Allspice, or other
Spice, in the water you melt the Soup in, which may
be flavoured with Mushroom Catsup (No. 439),&mdash;or
Eschalot Wine (No. 402),&mdash;Essence of Sweet Herbs
(No. 417),&mdash;Savoury Spice (Nos. 421, or 457),&mdash;Essence
of Celery (No. 409), &amp;c. or Zest (No. 255);&mdash;these
may be combined in the proportions most agreeable
to the palate of the Eater&mdash;and are as portable
as Portable Soup, for a very small portion will flavour
a Pint.</p>

<p>The Editor adds nothing to the solution of this
Soup, but a very little ground Black Pepper and some
Salt.</p>

<p><i>Mem.</i> <span class="smcap">This Portable Soup</span> is a most convenient
article in Cookery&mdash;especially in <i>Small Families</i>, where
it will save a great deal of time and trouble. It is
also <i>Economical</i>, for no more will be melted than is
wanted&mdash;so there is no waste.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Shin of Beef</span>, weighing nine pounds, and costing
1<i>s.</i> 10&frac12;<i>d.</i> produced nine ounces of concentrated Soup,
sufficiently reduced to keep for several months. After
the boiling, the Bones in this joint weighed two pounds
and a quarter, and the Meat two pounds and a quarter.</p>

<p>As it is difficult to obtain this ready-made of good
quality&mdash;and we could not find any proper and circumstantial
directions for making it, which on trial answered
the purpose,&mdash;and it is really a great acquisition to
the Army and Navy&mdash;to Travellers, Invalids, &amp;c.&mdash;the
Editor has bestowed some time, &amp;c. in endeavouring
to learn&mdash;and to teach how it may be prepared in
the easiest,&mdash;most economical and perfect manner.</p>

<p>The ordinary selling price is from 10<i>s.</i> to 12<i>s.</i>&mdash;but
you may make it according to the above Receipt for
3<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> per Pound&mdash;<i>i. e.</i> for 2&frac12;<i>d.</i> per Ounce, which will
make you a Pint of Broth.</p>

<p>Those who do not regard the expense, and like the
flavour, may add the lean of Ham, in the proportion of
a pound to eight pounds of Leg of Beef.</p>

<p>It may also be flavoured, by adding to it, at the
time you put the Broth into the smaller Stewpan,
Mushroom Catsup, Shallot Wine, Essences of Spice
or Herbs, &amp;c.;&mdash;we prefer it quite plain&mdash;it is then
ready to be converted in an instant into a basin of
Beef Tea for an Invalid, and any flavour may be
immediately communicated to it by the Magazine of
Taste (No. 463.)</p>

<p><i>Mutton Chops delicately Stewed, and good Mutton
Broth.</i>&mdash;(No. 490.)&mdash;Put a Pound of Chops into a
stewpan with cold water enough to cover them, and
half a pint over, and an Onion,&mdash;when it is coming to
a boil, skim it, cover the pan close, and set it <i>over a
very slow Fire</i> till the Chops are tender,&mdash;if they have
been kept a proper time, they will take about three
quarters of an hour&rsquo;s <i>very gentle simmering</i>. Send up
Turnips with them, (No. 130), they may be boiled with
the chops, skim well, and then send all up in a deep
dish, with the Broth they were stewed in.</p>

Not to mention the saliva which moistens the food, and
predisposes it to be dissolved, it cannot be doubted,
that when it is reduced to pieces by the action of the
Teeth, the gastric fluid penetrates, and attacking it at
more points, dissolves it more speedily than when it
was whole. This is true of menstrua in general, which
always dissolve bodies sooner when they have been previously
broken to pieces. This is also the reason why,
in other experiments, masticated bread and <i>dressed</i>
flesh were more readily dissolved than unchewed bread
and <i>raw</i> flesh. The boiling had made it tenderer, and
consequently disposed it to allow ingress to the gastric
fluid.&rdquo;&mdash;<span class="smcap">Spallanzani</span> <i>on Digestion</i>, vol. i. p. 277.</p>
